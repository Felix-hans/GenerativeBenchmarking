To solve the problem, we can use a greedy approach. We sort the satisfaction array in non-decreasing order, as preparing dishes with higher satisfaction levels earlier will yield a higher like-time coefficient. Then, we iterate through the sorted array and calculate the maximum like-time coefficient for each prefix of the array. We keep track of the maximum coefficient encountered so far and return it as the result.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort()  # Sort the satisfaction array in non-decreasing order
        n = len(satisfaction)
        max_coefficient = 0
        total_time = 0

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if satisfaction[i] + total_time <= 0:
                break
            total_time += satisfaction[i]
            max_coefficient += total_time

        return max_coefficient
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The function returns the expected outputs for the given examples.
