To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. The key idea is to sort the satisfaction values in descending order and then iterate over them to calculate the maximum sum of like-time coefficients.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        
        max_sum = 0  # Maximum sum of like-time coefficients
        total_time = 0  # Total time taken
        
        for s in satisfaction:
            if total_time + s <= 0:
                break  # If adding the current dish decreases the total time, stop adding more dishes
            
            total_time += s
            max_sum += total_time
        
        return max_sum
```

We start by sorting the `satisfaction` list in descending order. Then, we initialize `max_sum` and `total_time` to 0. We iterate over the sorted satisfaction values and check if adding the current dish to the total time would decrease the overall time. If it does, we break the loop because further dishes would only decrease the sum.

Otherwise, we update the `total_time` by adding the current satisfaction value, and update the `max_sum` by adding the product of `total_time` and `s`. This calculates the like-time coefficient for the current dish and adds it to the maximum sum.

Finally, we return the `max_sum` as the result.

Let's test the implementation with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The output matches the expected results provided in the examples.
