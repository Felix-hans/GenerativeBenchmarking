To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. We sort the satisfaction list in descending order and calculate the maximum like-time coefficient for each possible starting dish. We keep track of the maximum sum encountered so far and return it as the result.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` method in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort satisfaction in descending order
        max_sum = 0
        total_time = 0
        
        for s in satisfaction:
            if total_time + s > 0:
                total_time += s
                max_sum += total_time
            else:
                break
        
        return max_sum
```

Let's test the solution with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

# Example 2
satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

# Example 3
satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The output matches the expected results for the given examples.
