To solve this task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll sort the satisfaction values in descending order, and then iterate over them to calculate the maximum sum of like-time coefficients.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        
        max_sum = 0
        total_time = 0
        
        for s in satisfaction:
            if total_time + s <= 0:
                break
            total_time += s
            max_sum += total_time
        
        return max_sum
```

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. We start by sorting the `satisfaction` list in descending order using the `sort` method. This is necessary because we want to process the dishes with higher satisfaction levels first.

2. We initialize `max_sum` and `total_time` variables to keep track of the maximum sum of like-time coefficients and the total time taken.

3. We iterate over each satisfaction value `s` in the sorted list. If adding `s` to `total_time` makes it negative or zero, we break out of the loop since it's not beneficial to continue processing further dishes.

4. Otherwise, we add `s` to `total_time` and update `max_sum` by adding `total_time` to it. This accounts for the like-time coefficient of the current dish.

5. After the loop ends, we return the final `max_sum` as the maximum sum of like-time coefficients that the chef can obtain.

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxSatisfaction` function with your input to get the desired output.
