To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm combined with a priority queue (heapq) to efficiently select the engineers with the highest performance.

Here's the implementation of the `maxPerformance` function in Python:

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Create a list of tuples (speed, efficiency) representing the engineers
        engineers = list(zip(speed, efficiency))
        
        # Sort the engineers by their efficiency in descending order
        engineers.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        # Create a heap to keep track of the k engineers with the highest speeds
        speed_heap = []
        
        total_speed = 0
        max_performance = 0
        
        for engineer_speed, engineer_efficiency in engineers:
            # Add the current engineer's speed to the total speed
            total_speed += engineer_speed
            
            # Push the current engineer's speed to the heap
            heapq.heappush(speed_heap, engineer_speed)
            
            # If the heap size exceeds k, remove the engineer with the lowest speed
            if len(speed_heap) > k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(speed_heap)
            
            # Calculate the performance with the current engineer as the minimum efficiency
            performance = total_speed * engineer_efficiency
            
            # Update the maximum performance if necessary
            max_performance = max(max_performance, performance)
        
        # Return the maximum performance modulo 10^9 + 7
        return max_performance % (10**9 + 7)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log k) since we iterate over the engineers once and perform heap operations with a maximum size of k.
