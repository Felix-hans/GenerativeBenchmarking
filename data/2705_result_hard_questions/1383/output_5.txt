To solve this problem, we can follow the following steps:

1. Combine the `speed` and `efficiency` arrays into a list of tuples `(speed[i], efficiency[i])` for each engineer.
2. Sort the list of engineers in descending order of their efficiency.
3. Initialize a priority queue to store the speeds of the selected engineers, with the minimum speed at the top.
4. Initialize variables `total_speed` and `result` to 0.
5. Iterate over the sorted list of engineers.
    - Add the speed of the current engineer to `total_speed`.
    - Push the speed of the current engineer into the priority queue.
    - If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, pop the engineer with the minimum speed from the queue and subtract their speed from `total_speed`.
    - Calculate the current performance as `total_speed` multiplied by the efficiency of the current engineer.
    - Update `result` with the maximum performance seen so far.
6. Return `result` modulo 10^9 + 7.

Here's the implementation of the `maxPerformance` function in Python:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        engineers = sorted(zip(speed, efficiency), key=lambda x: -x[1])
        speed_heap = []
        total_speed = 0
        result = 0

        for curr_speed, curr_efficiency in engineers:
            total_speed += curr_speed
            heapq.heappush(speed_heap, curr_speed)

            if len(speed_heap) > k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(speed_heap)

            curr_performance = total_speed * curr_efficiency
            result = max(result, curr_performance)

        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxPerformance` method to test it with different inputs. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 6
speed = [2, 10, 3, 1, 5, 8]
efficiency = [5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 2]
k = 2
print(solution.maxPerformance(n, speed, efficiency, k))  # Output: 60
```

The code will output the maximum performance of the team based on the given inputs.
