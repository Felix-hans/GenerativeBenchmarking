To solve the given task, you can follow the following steps:

1. Create a frequency map to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.
2. Sort the frequency map based on the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted frequency map until you reach a point where the removed integers make up at least half of the original array size.
4. Return the minimum size of the set by counting the number of removed integers.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        frequency_map = Counter(arr)
        sorted_frequencies = sorted(frequency_map.values(), reverse=True)
        
        count = 0
        removed = 0
        for frequency in sorted_frequencies:
            removed += frequency
            count += 1
            if removed >= len(arr) // 2:
                break
        
        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` function with your input array `arr` to get the minimum size of the set. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

The code will output the minimum size of the set required to remove at least half of the integers from the array.
