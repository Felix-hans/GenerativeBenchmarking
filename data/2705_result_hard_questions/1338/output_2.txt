To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array.
2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted frequencies and keep removing the integers with the highest frequencies until at least half of the array is removed.
4. Track the number of integers removed and return it as the minimum size of the set.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each integer
        freq_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq_map[num] = freq_map.get(num, 0) + 1

        # Step 2: Sort the frequencies in descending order
        frequencies = sorted(freq_map.values(), reverse=True)

        # Step 3: Remove integers until at least half of the array is removed
        removed = 0
        removed_count = 0
        for freq in frequencies:
            removed += freq
            removed_count += 1
            if removed >= len(arr) // 2:
                break

        # Step 4: Return the minimum size of the set
        return removed_count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` method with your input array to get the minimum size of the set. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```
