To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array and store it in a dictionary.
2. Sort the dictionary by the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate over the sorted dictionary and keep removing integers until at least half of the array's elements are removed.
4. Return the count of removed integers.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each integer
        frequency = {}
        for num in arr:
            frequency[num] = frequency.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # Step 2: Sort the dictionary by frequencies in descending order
        sorted_freq = sorted(frequency.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        # Step 3: Remove integers until at least half of the array is removed
        count = 0
        removed = 0
        for num, freq in sorted_freq:
            count += 1
            removed += freq
            if removed >= len(arr) // 2:
                break
        
        # Step 4: Return the count of removed integers
        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` function with the input array to get the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

In the above example, the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed is 2.
