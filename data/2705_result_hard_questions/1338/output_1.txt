To solve the given task in Python, you can follow the following approach:

1. Create a frequency dictionary to store the count of occurrences of each integer in the array.
2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted frequencies and keep removing integers until at least half of the array is removed.
4. Return the number of integers removed.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        sorted_freq = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
        
        count = 0
        removed = 0
        for f in sorted_freq:
            count += 1
            removed += f
            if removed >= len(arr) // 2:
                return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` method with the input array to get the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed. Here's an example usage:

```python
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
2
```

Note: The `minSetSize` function assumes that the input array `arr` is a valid array with even length and contains integers within the given constraints.
