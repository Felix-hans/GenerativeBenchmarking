To solve the given task in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array `arr`. You can use a dictionary to store the counts, where the keys are the integers and the values are their frequencies.

2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.

3. Iterate over the frequencies and keep track of the total count of removed integers.

4. Check if the total count is greater than or equal to half the length of the array. If it is, return the current index as the minimum size of the set.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        counts = {}
        for num in arr:
            counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1

        frequencies = sorted(counts.values(), reverse=True)

        total_removed = 0
        for i, freq in enumerate(frequencies):
            total_removed += freq
            if total_removed >= len(arr) // 2:
                return i + 1

        return len(arr) // 2  # In case the loop completes without reaching half of the array size
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` method with the array as an argument to test the implementation. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
print(solution.minSetSize(arr))  # Output: 2

arr = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
print(solution.minSetSize(arr))  # Output: 1
```

The `minSetSize` function returns the minimum size of the set needed to remove at least half of the integers in the array.
