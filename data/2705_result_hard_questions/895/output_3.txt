To design a stack-like data structure that can push elements and pop the most frequent element, we can use a combination of a dictionary and a list.

In the dictionary, we will store the frequency of each element in the stack. The key will be the element, and the value will be the frequency.

In the list, we will maintain stacks of elements based on their frequency. Each stack will store the elements that have the same frequency. The index of the list will represent the frequency value.

Here's the implementation of the `FreqStack` class in Python:

```python
class FreqStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.freq_dict = {}
        self.stack_list = [[]]

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        # Increase the frequency of the element
        if val in self.freq_dict:
            freq = self.freq_dict[val] + 1
            self.freq_dict[val] = freq
        else:
            freq = 1
            self.freq_dict[val] = freq

        # Update the stack_list with the element's frequency
        if freq == len(self.stack_list):
            self.stack_list.append([val])
        else:
            self.stack_list[freq].append(val)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # Get the most frequent element from the topmost stack
        most_freq_stack = self.stack_list[-1]
        val = most_freq_stack.pop()
        
        # Update the frequency of the element in freq_dict
        freq = self.freq_dict[val] - 1
        if freq == 0:
            del self.freq_dict[val]
        else:
            self.freq_dict[val] = freq

        # If the topmost stack becomes empty, remove it from stack_list
        if len(most_freq_stack) == 0 and len(self.stack_list) > 1:
            self.stack_list.pop()

        return val
```

Now, let's test the code with the given example:

```python
freqStack = FreqStack()
freqStack.push(5)
freqStack.push(7)
freqStack.push(5)
freqStack.push(7)
freqStack.push(4)
freqStack.push(5)
print(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 5
print(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 7
print(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 5
print(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 4
```

The code should produce the following output, matching the expected output from the example:

```
5
7
5
4
```

Note: The implementation assumes that there will always be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop()`.
