Apologies for the mistake. The previous implementation didn't handle the case where the count of cards is not a multiple of the group size. Here's the updated code that handles this scenario correctly:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        # Count the frequency of each card
        count = {}
        for card in hand:
            count[card] = count.get(card, 0) + 1

        # Sort the unique cards in ascending order
        cards = sorted(set(hand))

        for card in cards:
            while count.get(card, 0) > 0:
                # Start a new group with the current card
                for i in range(card, card + groupSize):
                    if count.get(i, 0) == 0:
                        # The consecutive cards are not available
                        return False
                    count[i] -= 1

        return True
```

Now, it uses a `while` loop instead of a single check to ensure that all possible groups are formed from the available cards.

Let's test the updated code with the previous test cases:

```python
solution = Solution()
hand = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
groupSize = 3
print(solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize))  # Output: True

hand = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
groupSize = 4
print(solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize))  # Output: False
```

Now, the code should provide the correct results for both cases.
