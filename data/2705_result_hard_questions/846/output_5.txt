Apologies for the mistake. The previous implementation incorrectly checked the next consecutive cards by directly accessing `freq[card + i]` without considering the case when `card + i` is not present in the `freq` dictionary. To address this issue, we need to check if `card + i` exists in the dictionary and has a positive frequency.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `isNStraightHand` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the hand can be divided into groups of size groupSize
        if len(hand) % groupSize != 0:
            return False

        # Count the frequency of each card in the hand
        freq = {}
        for card in hand:
            freq[card] = freq.get(card, 0) + 1

        # Iterate through the hand to form groups
        for card in sorted(hand):
            if freq[card] > 0:
                # Check the next consecutive cards
                for i in range(groupSize):
                    next_card = card + i
                    if next_card not in freq or freq[next_card] <= 0:
                        return False
                    freq[next_card] -= 1

        return True
```

Now, you can test the function again with the provided test case:

```python
solution = Solution()
hand = [2, 1]
groupSize = 2
result = solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

With this corrected implementation, the test case should return `True` as expected.
