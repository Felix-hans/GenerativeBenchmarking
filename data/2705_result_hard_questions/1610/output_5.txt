Apologies for the confusion. It seems I made a mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the field of view and check which points fall within that range. We can achieve this by calculating the angle between each point and the location, and then count the number of points within the field of view.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
from math import atan2, degrees

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        angles = []
        overlap = 0
        
        for point in points:
            x, y = point
            if x == location[0] and y == location[1]:
                overlap += 1
                continue
            angles.append(degrees(atan2(y - location[1], x - location[0])))
        
        angles.sort()
        n = len(angles)
        
        # Duplicate the angles list to handle wraparound from 360 to 0 degrees
        angles += [angle + angle_val for angle_val in angles]
        
        max_points = 0
        
        # Use sliding window technique to find the maximum number of points in the field of view
        start = 0
        for end in range(n * 2):
            while angles[end] - angles[start] > angle:
                start += 1
            max_points = max(max_points, end - start + 1)
        
        return max_points + overlap
```

Now the code should produce the correct result for the given test case and other cases as well.
