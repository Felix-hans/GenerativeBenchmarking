Apologies for the mistake. The issue in the code is that we need to consider both the positive and negative angles when sorting the points. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the point is at the same location as the given location.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
from typing import List
import math

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        polar_points = []
        location_x, location_y = location[0], location[1]
        same_location = 0  # Number of points at the same location as the given location
        
        for point in points:
            point_x, point_y = point[0], point[1]
            dx, dy = point_x - location_x, point_y - location_y
            
            # Handle points at the same location as the given location
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                same_location += 1
                continue
            
            polar_angle = math.atan2(dy, dx) * (180 / math.pi)
            polar_points.append(polar_angle)
            polar_points.append(polar_angle + 360)  # Consider both positive and negative angles
        
        polar_points.sort()
        
        max_points_seen = 0
        current_points_seen = 0
        start_index = 0
        
        for i in range(len(polar_points)):
            current_points_seen += 1
            
            while polar_points[i] - polar_points[start_index] > angle:
                current_points_seen -= 1
                start_index += 1
            
            max_points_seen = max(max_points_seen, current_points_seen)
        
        return max_points_seen + same_location
```

Now, the code handles points at the same location as the given location and considers both positive and negative angles when sorting the points.

Let's test the updated code with the given example:

```python
solution = Solution()
points = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]
angle = 90
location = [1, 1]
result = solution.visiblePoints(points, angle, location)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

The updated code should now produce the correct output for the given example.
