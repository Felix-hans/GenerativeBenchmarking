Apologies for the error in the previous implementation. The issue lies in the calculation of the angles when rotating by 360 degrees. To fix this, we need to consider the angles in the range of [0, 360] degrees instead of adding `angle` to each angle. 

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
from math import atan2, degrees
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        angles = []
        same_point_count = 0
        loc_x, loc_y = location
        
        for x, y in points:
            if x == loc_x and y == loc_y:
                same_point_count += 1
            else:
                angles.append(degrees(atan2(y - loc_y, x - loc_x)))
        
        angles.sort()
        max_points = 0
        
        for i in range(len(angles)):
            angles.append(angles[i] + 360)  # Add rotated angles
        
        left = 0
        for right in range(len(angles)):
            while angles[right] - angles[left] > angle:
                left += 1
            max_points = max(max_points, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_points + same_point_count
```

Now let's test the code with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

points1 = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]
angle1 = 90
location1 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points1, angle1, location1))
# Output: 3

points2 = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [1, 1]]
angle2 = 90
location2 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points2, angle2, location2))
# Output: 4

points3 = [[1, 0], [2, 1]]
angle3 = 13
location3 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points3, angle3, location3))
# Output: 1
```

Now the code should produce the correct results.
