I apologize for the error. The code provided in my previous response has a time complexity of O(n*k), which can be inefficient for large inputs. We can optimize the solution using a deque to store the maximum sum subsequence.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n  # dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequence ending at index i
        dq = deque()  # Deque to store the indices of potential elements in the subsequence
        max_sum = float('-inf')  # Variable to keep track of the maximum sum
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Remove elements outside the window of size k
            if dq and dq[0] < i - k:
                dq.popleft()
            
            # Calculate the maximum sum at the current index
            dp[i] = nums[i] + max(0, dp[dq[0]]) if dq else nums[i]
            
            # Remove elements from the deque that are smaller than the current element
            while dq and dp[i] >= dp[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            
            dq.append(i)  # Add the current index to the deque
            
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])  # Update the overall maximum sum
        
        return max_sum
```

This updated implementation uses a deque to store the indices of potential elements in the subsequence. We remove elements from the deque that are smaller than the current element, ensuring that the deque always contains elements in decreasing order of their corresponding sums. This optimization allows us to achieve a time complexity of O(n).

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
nums = [10, 2, -10, 5, 20]
k = 2

solution = Solution()
result = solution.constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k)
print(result)  # Output: 37
```

I apologize for the previous error, and I hope this updated implementation resolves the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
