To solve the given problem, we can use a greedy approach. We need to sort the tasks in descending order based on the difference between the actual and minimum energy required for each task. This way, we prioritize tasks with higher differences, as they require more energy to complete.

Here's the implementation of the `minimumEffort` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumEffort(self, tasks):
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
        energy = 0
        initial_energy = 0
        
        for task in tasks:
            actual_energy, minimum_energy = task
            if energy < minimum_energy:
                initial_energy += minimum_energy - energy
                energy = minimum_energy
            energy -= actual_energy
        
        return initial_energy
```

We start by sorting the `tasks` array in descending order based on the difference between the actual and minimum energy required for each task. This is done using the `sort` function with a custom key that calculates the difference.

Next, we initialize `energy` and `initial_energy` to zero. `energy` represents the remaining energy after completing tasks, and `initial_energy` represents the minimum initial energy required.

We iterate through each task in the sorted array. For each task, we check if the remaining `energy` is less than the minimum energy required `minimum_energy`. If so, we update the `initial_energy` by adding the difference between `minimum_energy` and `energy`. We also update the `energy` to be equal to `minimum_energy` since we need at least that much energy to start the task.

After that, we subtract the actual energy `actual_energy` from the `energy` variable to simulate completing the task.

Finally, we return the `initial_energy`, which represents the minimum initial energy required to finish all the tasks.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minimumEffort` function with the input array `tasks` to test it out.
