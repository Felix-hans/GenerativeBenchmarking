To solve this task, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to sort the tasks in descending order based on the difference between the minimum and actual energy required. This way, we always start with the task that requires the most additional energy to complete.

Here's the implementation of the `minimumEffort` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumEffort(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
        total_energy = 0
        current_energy = 0
        
        for task in tasks:
            actual, minimum = task
            if current_energy < minimum:
                energy_diff = minimum - current_energy
                total_energy += energy_diff
                current_energy += energy_diff
            current_energy -= actual
        
        return total_energy
```

In this implementation, we sort the `tasks` list based on the difference between `minimum` and `actual` energy in descending order. Then, we iterate over each task and check if our current energy is sufficient to start the task. If not, we calculate the additional energy required and add it to the total energy. After that, we subtract the actual energy spent on the task from the current energy.

Finally, we return the `total_energy`, which represents the minimum initial amount of energy needed to finish all the tasks.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minimumEffort` function with the input tasks to test it:

```python
tasks = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minimumEffort(tasks)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```
