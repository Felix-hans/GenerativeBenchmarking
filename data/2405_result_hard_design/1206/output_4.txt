Sure! Here's the implementation of the Skiplist class in Python:

```python
import random

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=None):
        self.val = val
        self.right = None
        self.down = None

class Skiplist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = ListNode()
        self.levels = [self.head]

    def search(self, target: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            if curr.val == target:
                return True
            elif curr.right is None or curr.right.val > target:
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.right
        return False

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        nodes = []
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            if curr.right is None or curr.right.val > num:
                nodes.append(curr)
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.right

        insert = True
        down = None
        while insert and nodes:
            node = nodes.pop()
            node.right = ListNode(num)
            node.right.down = down
            down = node.right
            insert = random.random() < 0.5  # 50% chance to go up one level

            if insert:
                new_node = ListNode()
                new_node.down = self.levels[-1]
                self.levels.append(new_node)
                node.right.right = new_node

    def erase(self, num: int) -> bool:
        found = False
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            if curr.right is None or curr.right.val > num:
                curr = curr.down
            elif curr.right.val == num:
                found = True
                curr.right = curr.right.right
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.right
        return found
```

This implementation uses a skip list with multiple levels. Each level is a sorted linked list, and the levels are connected using the `down` pointer. When searching for a target value, we traverse the levels and move to the right or down based on the comparisons with the current node's value.

The `add` method inserts a new value into the skip list. It starts from the top level and moves down, inserting new nodes at each level. The `erase` method removes a value from the skip list by linking the previous node to the next node.

You can create a `Skiplist` object and call the methods as follows:

```python
obj = Skiplist()
param_1 = obj.search(target)
obj.add(num)
param_3 = obj.erase(num)
```

Note that this implementation uses a 50% probability for each level to promote nodes to the next level. This can be adjusted based on the desired performance characteristics.
