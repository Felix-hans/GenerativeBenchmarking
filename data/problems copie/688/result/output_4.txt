To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the probability of the knight remaining on the board after each move. We can create a 3D array to store the probabilities for each cell, where the dimensions represent the row, column, and the number of remaining moves.

Here's the implementation of the `knightProbability` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def knightProbability(self, n: int, k: int, row: int, column: int) -> float:
        # Define the possible moves of a knight
        moves = [(2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)]
        
        # Create a 3D array to store the probabilities
        dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        # Initialize the probability for the starting cell
        dp[0][row][column] = 1
        
        # Iterate over the number of moves
        for m in range(1, k + 1):
            # Iterate over each cell on the board
            for r in range(n):
                for c in range(n):
                    # Calculate the probability for the current cell
                    for move in moves:
                        new_r = r + move[0]
                        new_c = c + move[1]
                        if 0 <= new_r < n and 0 <= new_c < n:
                            dp[m][r][c] += dp[m - 1][new_r][new_c] / 8.0
        
        # Sum the probabilities for all cells after k moves
        probability = sum(sum(row) for row in dp[k])
        
        return probability
```

You can then create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `knightProbability` method with the desired inputs:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 3
k = 2
row = 0
column = 0
result = solution.knightProbability(n, k, row, column)
print(result)
```

The output will be:

```
0.0625
```

Similarly, you can test other inputs by modifying the values of `n`, `k`, `row`, and `column`.
