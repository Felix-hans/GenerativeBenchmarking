To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will sort the engineers based on their efficiency in descending order. Then, for each engineer, we will calculate the performance of a team consisting of that engineer and at most k - 1 engineers with higher efficiency.

Here's the implementation of the `maxPerformance` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Create a list of tuples (speed, efficiency) for each engineer
        engineers = zip(speed, efficiency)
        engineers = sorted(engineers, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        max_performance = 0
        total_speed = 0
        min_efficiency = float('inf')
        heap = []
        
        for spd, eff in engineers:
            # If we have more than k engineers, remove the one with the lowest speed
            if len(heap) >= k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Add the current engineer's speed to the total speed
            total_speed += spd
            
            # Add the current engineer's speed to the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, spd)
            
            # Update the minimum efficiency
            min_efficiency = min(min_efficiency, eff)
            
            # Calculate the current performance
            performance = total_speed * min_efficiency
            
            # Update the maximum performance
            max_performance = max(max_performance, performance)
        
        # Return the maximum performance modulo 10^9 + 7
        return max_performance % (10**9 + 7)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxPerformance` function with the appropriate arguments to test it out. For example:

```python
n = 6
speed = [2, 10, 3, 1, 5, 8]
efficiency = [5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 2]
k = 2

solution = Solution()
result = solution.maxPerformance(n, speed, efficiency, k)
print(result)  # Output: 60
```

The solution uses a min-heap to keep track of the k engineers with the highest speeds. By doing so, we can maintain the current maximum performance efficiently. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), where n is the number of engineers.
