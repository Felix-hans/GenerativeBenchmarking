To solve the problem, we can follow the following steps:

1. Combine the speeds and efficiencies of the engineers into a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an engineer with their speed and efficiency.
2. Sort the list of engineers based on their efficiencies in descending order.
3. Create a priority queue to keep track of the speeds of the selected engineers. We will use a min-heap for this purpose.
4. Initialize the total_speed variable to keep track of the sum of speeds.
5. Initialize the max_performance variable to keep track of the maximum performance.
6. Iterate over the sorted engineers list.
7. Add the current engineer's speed to the total_speed variable.
8. Push the current engineer's speed into the priority queue.
9. If the size of the priority queue exceeds k, pop the engineer with the minimum speed from the priority queue and subtract their speed from the total_speed.
10. Calculate the current performance by multiplying the total_speed with the current engineer's efficiency.
11. Update the max_performance if the current performance is greater.
12. Finally, return the max_performance modulo 10^9 + 7.

Here's the implementation of the `maxPerformance` function in Python:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        engineers = sorted(zip(efficiency, speed), reverse=True)  # Sort engineers by efficiency (descending order)
        speed_heap = []
        total_speed = 0
        max_performance = 0

        for curr_efficiency, curr_speed in engineers:
            total_speed += curr_speed
            heapq.heappush(speed_heap, curr_speed)

            if len(speed_heap) > k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(speed_heap)

            performance = total_speed * curr_efficiency
            max_performance = max(max_performance, performance)

        return max_performance % (10**9 + 7)
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxPerformance` method with the provided inputs to get the maximum performance of the team. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 6
speed = [2, 10, 3, 1, 5, 8]
efficiency = [5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 2]
k = 2
result = solution.maxPerformance(n, speed, efficiency, k)
print(result)  # Output: 60
```

You can also test the function with the other provided examples.
