To solve the problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We can treat each bus stop as a node in a graph and each bus route as an edge connecting the bus stops.

Here's the Python implementation of the `numBusesToDestination` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Set
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def numBusesToDestination(self, routes: List[List[int]], source: int, target: int) -> int:
        if source == target:
            return 0

        # Build a graph where each bus stop is a node and each route is an edge
        graph = self.buildGraph(routes)

        # Initialize a queue for BFS and a set to track visited bus stops
        queue = deque([(source, 0)])
        visited = set([source])

        while queue:
            curr_stop, bus_count = queue.popleft()

            if curr_stop == target:
                return bus_count

            for neighbor in graph[curr_stop]:
                for bus in graph[curr_stop][neighbor]:
                    if bus not in visited:
                        visited.add(bus)
                        queue.append((neighbor, bus_count + 1))

        return -1

    def buildGraph(self, routes: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, Dict[int, Set[int]]]:
        graph = {}

        for bus, route in enumerate(routes):
            for stop in route:
                if stop not in graph:
                    graph[stop] = {}

                for neighbor in route:
                    if neighbor != stop:
                        if neighbor not in graph[stop]:
                            graph[stop][neighbor] = set()

                        graph[stop][neighbor].add(bus)

        return graph
```

The `numBusesToDestination` function takes in the `routes` list, `source`, and `target` as parameters and returns the least number of buses needed to travel from `source` to `target`. It performs a breadth-first search on the bus stops, starting from the `source` stop and considering neighboring stops along the bus routes.

The `buildGraph` function is a helper function that constructs a graph representation of the bus routes. It returns a dictionary where each bus stop is a key, and its value is another dictionary. The inner dictionary represents the neighboring stops and the set of buses that connect them.

The main function initializes a queue with the `source` stop and a bus count of 0. It also keeps track of visited stops using a set. The BFS loop continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, it dequeues a stop and checks if it is the `target`. If so, it returns the current bus count. Otherwise, it explores the neighboring stops by looking up the graph. If a neighboring stop has not been visited, it is added to the queue with an incremented bus count.

If the BFS completes without finding the `target`, the function returns -1 to indicate that it is not possible to reach the destination.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numBusesToDestination` function with the given input to test it:

```python
routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
source = 1
target = 6

solution = Solution()
result = solution.numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

```python
routes = [[7, 12], [4, 5, 15], [6], [15, 19], [9, 12, 13]]
source = 15
target = 12

solution = Solution()
result = solution.numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target)
