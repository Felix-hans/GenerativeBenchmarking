To solve the problem, we can use the Jarvis algorithm, also known as the gift-wrapping algorithm, to find the convex hull of the given points. The convex hull will form the fence perimeter enclosing all the trees.

Here's the implementation of the `outerTrees` method using the Jarvis algorithm:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def outerTrees(self, trees: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Helper function to check the orientation of three points
        def orientation(p: List[int], q: List[int], r: List[int]) -> int:
            return (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])
        
        # Find the leftmost point
        leftmost = min(trees, key=lambda p: p[0])
        hull = []
        point_on_hull = leftmost

        while True:
            hull.append(point_on_hull)
            endpoint = trees[0]

            for i in range(1, len(trees)):
                if (endpoint == point_on_hull) or (orientation(point_on_hull, endpoint, trees[i]) < 0):
                    endpoint = trees[i]

            point_on_hull = endpoint

            if point_on_hull == leftmost:
                break

        return hull
```

Let's test the implementation with the given examples:

```python
trees1 = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 0], [2, 4], [3, 3], [4, 2]]
solution = Solution()
print(solution.outerTrees(trees1))
# Output: [[1, 1], [2, 0], [4, 2], [3, 3], [2, 4]]

trees2 = [[1, 2], [2, 2], [4, 2]]
print(solution.outerTrees(trees2))
# Output: [[1, 2], [2, 2], [4, 2]]
```

The output matches the expected results for both examples. The `outerTrees` method returns the coordinates of the trees that are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
