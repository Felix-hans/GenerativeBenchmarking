To solve the problem, we can use a hash table to count the number of rabbits with each color. 

Here's the implementation of the `numRabbits` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        total = 0

        for ans in answers:
            if ans == 0:
                # If the rabbit claims there are 0 rabbits of its color,
                # we count it separately.
                total += 1
            elif ans not in count or count[ans] == 0:
                # If we haven't seen a rabbit with the same answer before
                # or we have counted all rabbits with the same answer,
                # we start a new group of rabbits with the same color.
                count[ans] = ans
                total += ans + 1
            else:
                # If we have already counted some rabbits with the same answer,
                # we decrement the count and continue counting.
                count[ans] -= 1

        return total
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numRabbits` function with your input array to get the minimum number of rabbits in the forest. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
answers = [1, 1, 2]
minimum_rabbits = solution.numRabbits(answers)
print(minimum_rabbits)  # Output: 5
```

```python
solution = Solution()
answers = [10, 10, 10]
minimum_rabbits = solution.numRabbits(answers)
print(minimum_rabbits)  # Output: 11
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `answers` array.
