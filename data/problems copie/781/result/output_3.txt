To solve the given task in Python, you can use a dictionary to keep track of the number of rabbits with each color. Here's the implementation of the `numRabbits` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        rabbits = 0

        for ans in answers:
            if ans == 0:
                rabbits += 1
                continue

            if ans not in count:
                count[ans] = 1
            else:
                count[ans] += 1

            if count[ans] > ans + 1:
                count.pop(ans)
                rabbits += ans + 1

        for ans, freq in count.items():
            rabbits += ans + 1

        return rabbits
```

Here's how the function works:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `count` to store the frequencies of rabbit colors and a variable `rabbits` to keep track of the total number of rabbits.
2. Iterate through each answer in the `answers` list.
3. If the answer is 0, it means the rabbit has a unique color. Increment `rabbits` by 1 and move to the next answer.
4. If the answer is not 0, check if it exists in the `count` dictionary.
   - If it doesn't exist, initialize its count as 1 in the `count` dictionary.
   - If it exists, increment its count by 1.
5. If the count of a particular color exceeds the number of rabbits with that color plus 1, it means there are more rabbits of that color than previously counted. Remove the color from the `count` dictionary and add the current count plus 1 to `rabbits`.
6. Iterate through the remaining colors in the `count` dictionary and add their counts plus 1 to `rabbits`.
7. Finally, return the total number of rabbits.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numRabbits` method, passing the `answers` list as an argument, to get the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.
