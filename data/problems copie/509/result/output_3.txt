You can implement the task in Python using the given class and method as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            fib_prev = 0
            fib_current = 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                fib_next = fib_prev + fib_current
                fib_prev = fib_current
                fib_current = fib_next
            return fib_current
```

This implementation follows the Fibonacci sequence definition and uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number for the given input `n`. The initial Fibonacci numbers `F(0)` and `F(1)` are handled separately, and then the loop iterates from `2` to `n`, calculating each Fibonacci number iteratively.

To use this implementation, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `fib` method, passing the desired value of `n`. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 6
result = solution.fib(n)
print(result)
```

In this example, the input `n` is set to `6`, and the Fibonacci number `F(6)` will be calculated and printed.
