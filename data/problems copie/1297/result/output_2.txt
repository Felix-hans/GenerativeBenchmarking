Here's the implementation of the `maxFreq` function in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxFreq(self, s: str, maxLetters: int, minSize: int, maxSize: int) -> int:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        max_occurrences = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - minSize + 1):
            substring = s[i:i+minSize]
            unique_letters = len(set(substring))
            
            if unique_letters <= maxLetters:
                counts[substring] += 1
                max_occurrences = max(max_occurrences, counts[substring])
        
        return max_occurrences
```

Explanation:

1. We create a `defaultdict` called `counts` to store the counts of each valid substring.
2. We initialize `max_occurrences` to 0, which will hold the maximum number of occurrences.
3. We iterate over the input string `s` from index 0 to `len(s) - minSize + 1`. This ensures that we consider all possible substrings of length `minSize`.
4. For each substring, we check the number of unique letters using `len(set(substring))`. If the number of unique letters is less than or equal to `maxLetters`, it satisfies the condition.
5. We increment the count of the substring in the `counts` dictionary and update `max_occurrences` if the current count is greater than `max_occurrences`.
6. Finally, we return the value of `max_occurrences`, which represents the maximum number of occurrences of any valid substring.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxFreq` function with the given inputs to obtain the desired result.
