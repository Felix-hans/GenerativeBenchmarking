To rearrange the characters of a string `s` such that no two adjacent characters are the same, we can follow a greedy approach. We'll start by counting the frequency of each character in `s` using a dictionary. Then, we'll build a new string by appending characters from the most frequent to the least frequent, making sure that no two adjacent characters are the same.

Here's the implementation of the `reorganizeString` method in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        counter = Counter(s)
        most_common = counter.most_common()  # List of (char, freq) tuples, sorted by frequency

        # Check if it's possible to rearrange the string
        max_freq = most_common[0][1]
        if max_freq > (len(s) + 1) // 2:
            return ""

        result = [''] * len(s)
        index = 0

        # Build the new string, starting with the most frequent characters
        for char, freq in most_common:
            for _ in range(freq):
                result[index] = char
                index += 2  # Skip one index to avoid adjacent characters
                if index >= len(s):
                    index = 1  # If we reach the end, start from index 1
        return "".join(result)
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `reorganizeString` method with your desired string as an argument. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "aab"
rearranged = solution.reorganizeString(s)
print(rearranged)
```

Output:
```
aba
```

```python
s = "aaab"
rearranged = solution.reorganizeString(s)
print(rearranged)
```

Output:
```
""
```

Note that if it's not possible to rearrange the string without having adjacent characters the same, the method returns an empty string `""` as mentioned in the problem statement.
