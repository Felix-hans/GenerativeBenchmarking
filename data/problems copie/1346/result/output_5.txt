Certainly! Here's the Python implementation of the task:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr):
        seen = set()
        for num in arr:
            if num * 2 in seen or num / 2 in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(num)
        return False
```

In this implementation, we use a set called `seen` to keep track of the numbers we have encountered so far. We iterate through the array `arr` and for each number, we check if either its double (`num * 2`) or half (`num / 2`) exists in the `seen` set. If we find a match, we return `True`. Otherwise, we add the current number to the `seen` set and continue. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a match, we return `False`.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `checkIfExist` method to test it with different input arrays. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.checkIfExist([10, 2, 5, 3]))  # Output: True
print(solution.checkIfExist([3, 1, 7, 11]))  # Output: False
```

Make sure to import the `List` class from the `typing` module if you haven't already done so:

```python
from typing import List
```
