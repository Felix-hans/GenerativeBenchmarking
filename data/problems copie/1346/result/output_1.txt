Here's the Python implementation of the task:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()  # Store the seen numbers
        
        for num in arr:
            if num * 2 in seen or (num % 2 == 0 and num // 2 in seen):
                return True
            seen.add(num)
        
        return False
```

In this solution, we iterate through each number in the array and check if either `num * 2` or `num // 2` (if `num` is even) is already present in the `seen` set. If we find a match, we return `True` immediately. Otherwise, we add the current number to the `seen` set. If we exhaust the loop without finding a match, we return `False`.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `checkIfExist` method with the input array to test it. Here's an example:

```python
arr = [10, 2, 5, 3]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.checkIfExist(arr)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

Hope this helps!
