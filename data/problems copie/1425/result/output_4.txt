Here's the implementation of the `constrainedSubsetSum` function in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        deque_ = deque()
        max_sum = float('-inf')

        for i in range(n):
            if deque_ and i - deque_[0] > k:
                deque_.popleft()

            dp[i] = nums[i] + max(0, dp[deque_[0]]) if deque_ else nums[i]
            
            while deque_ and dp[i] >= dp[deque_[-1]]:
                deque_.pop()

            deque_.append(i)

            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])

        return max_sum
```

The function takes an input array `nums` and an integer `k` as parameters and returns the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence that satisfies the given condition.

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to track the maximum sum of subsequences. It maintains a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of potential elements in the subsequence. The deque is used to efficiently find the maximum sum within the allowed range `k`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
