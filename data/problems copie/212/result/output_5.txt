Sure! Here's the implementation of the given task in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board, words):
        # Create a trie to store the words
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            node = trie
            for char in word:
                node = node.setdefault(char, {})
            node['_end'] = True

        # Define the DFS function to search for words on the board
        def dfs(i, j, node, path):
            char = board[i][j]
            if char in node:
                path += char
                node = node[char]
                if '_end' in node:
                    result.append(path)
                    del node['_end']  # Remove the word from trie to avoid duplicates

                # Mark the cell as visited
                board[i][j] = '#'

                # Explore the neighboring cells
                if i > 0: dfs(i - 1, j, node, path)
                if i < len(board) - 1: dfs(i + 1, j, node, path)
                if j > 0: dfs(i, j - 1, node, path)
                if j < len(board[0]) - 1: dfs(i, j + 1, node, path)

                # Restore the cell
                board[i][j] = char

        # Initialize variables
        result = []
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                dfs(i, j, trie, "")

        return result
```

You can use the `findWords` method of the `Solution` class to find the words on the board. Here's an example usage:

```python
board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
solution = Solution()
output = solution.findWords(board, words)
print(output)  # Output: ["eat", "oath"]
```

Similarly, you can test with different inputs and words to find the desired words on the board.
