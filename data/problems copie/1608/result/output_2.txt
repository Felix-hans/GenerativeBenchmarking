Here's the implementation of the `specialArray` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def specialArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        counts = [0] * (n + 1)  # Initialize counts array with zeros

        # Count the occurrences of numbers in nums
        for num in nums:
            if num <= n:
                counts[num] += 1
            else:
                counts[n] += 1

        greater_count = 0
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            greater_count += counts[i]
            if greater_count == i:
                return i

        return -1
```

This solution works as follows:

1. We initialize an array called `counts` of length `n + 1` with zeros. This array will be used to count the occurrences of numbers in `nums`.
2. We iterate through `nums` and update the count in `counts` for each number. If the number is greater than `n`, we increment the count at index `n`.
3. We iterate in reverse order through the `counts` array, starting from `n`. We keep track of the cumulative count of numbers greater than or equal to the current index.
4. If the cumulative count is equal to the current index, we have found the special number `x`. We return `x`.
5. If no special number is found after the iteration, we return -1.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `specialArray` method on it to test the solution with different inputs. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 5]
result = solution.specialArray(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

I hope this helps!
