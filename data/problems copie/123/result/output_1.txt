To solve this task, we can use dynamic programming to find the maximum profit we can achieve with at most two transactions.

Here's the Python implementation for the given task:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        if not prices:
            return 0

        n = len(prices)
        max_k = 2  # Maximum number of transactions allowed

        # Initialize the DP table
        dp = [[[0] * 2 for _ in range(max_k + 1)] for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            for k in range(max_k, 0, -1):
                if i == 0:
                    # Base case: no previous prices
                    dp[i][k][0] = 0
                    dp[i][k][1] = -prices[i]
                else:
                    # Update the DP table based on different cases
                    dp[i][k][0] = max(dp[i - 1][k][0], dp[i - 1][k][1] + prices[i])
                    dp[i][k][1] = max(dp[i - 1][k][1], dp[i - 1][k - 1][0] - prices[i])

        # Return the maximum profit after completing the transactions
        return dp[n - 1][max_k][0]
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxProfit` method with your input array:

```python
prices = [3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]
solution = Solution()
max_profit = solution.maxProfit(prices)
print(max_profit)
```

The output will be:
```
6
```

You can similarly test the code with other input arrays to find the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.
