To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve at each day considering the two transactions.

Here's the implementation of the `maxProfit` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        n = len(prices)
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        
        # Create arrays to store the maximum profit for the first and second transactions
        max_profit_1 = [0] * n
        max_profit_2 = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate the maximum profit for the first transaction
        min_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            max_profit_1[i] = max(max_profit_1[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
        # Calculate the maximum profit for the second transaction
        max_price = prices[n-1]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            max_profit_2[i] = max(max_profit_2[i+1], max_price - prices[i])
        
        # Calculate the maximum overall profit
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, max_profit_1[i] + max_profit_2[i])
        
        return max_profit
```

Here's how the code works:

1. We first check if the length of the prices array is less than 2. If so, it means there are not enough prices to make any transactions, so we return 0.

2. We initialize two arrays, `max_profit_1` and `max_profit_2`, with all elements set to 0. These arrays will store the maximum profit for the first and second transactions, respectively.

3. We iterate over the prices array to calculate the maximum profit for the first transaction. We keep track of the minimum price encountered so far and calculate the maximum profit by subtracting the minimum price from the current price. The maximum profit for each day is stored in the `max_profit_1` array.

4. We then iterate over the prices array in reverse order to calculate the maximum profit for the second transaction. We keep track of the maximum price encountered so far and calculate the maximum profit by subtracting the current price from the maximum price. The maximum profit for each day is stored in the `max_profit_2` array.

5. Finally, we iterate over both `max_profit_1` and `max_profit_2` arrays and calculate the maximum overall profit by summing the corresponding elements and keeping track of the maximum value.

6. We return the maximum overall profit as the result.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxProfit` function with the `prices` array as an argument to test it out.
