To solve the given task, we can use backtracking to generate all possible palindrome partitions of the string. Here's the implementation of the `partition` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = []
        self.backtrack(s, [], result)
        return result
    
    def backtrack(self, s: str, current: List[str], result: List[List[str]]):
        # Base case: if we have processed the entire string, add the current partition to the result
        if not s:
            result.append(current[:])
            return
        
        # Recursive case: generate all possible palindromic substrings and continue partitioning
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            substring = s[:i]
            if self.is_palindrome(substring):
                current.append(substring)
                self.backtrack(s[i:], current, result)
                current.pop()  # Backtrack by removing the last added palindrome substring
    
    def is_palindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return s == s[::-1]
```

This solution maintains a list `current` to keep track of the current partition being constructed. At each step, we generate all possible palindromic substrings starting from the beginning of the string. If a substring is a palindrome, we add it to `current` and recursively continue partitioning the remaining part of the string. Once we have processed the entire string, we add the current partition to the `result` list.

The `is_palindrome` method is used to check if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `partition` method with the input string:

```python
s = "aab"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.partition(s)
print(result)
```

This will output:
```
[['a', 'a', 'b'], ['aa', 'b']]
```

Similarly, you can test the solution with other input strings.
