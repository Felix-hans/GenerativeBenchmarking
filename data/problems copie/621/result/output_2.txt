To solve the given task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Count the frequency of each task using a dictionary.
2. Find the task with the maximum frequency. Let's say the maximum frequency is `max_freq`.
3. Calculate the number of idle slots between the tasks using the formula: `(max_freq - 1) * (n + 1)`.
   - Explanation: After placing the tasks with the maximum frequency, we need to insert idle slots between them. The number of idle slots required is `(max_freq - 1) * (n + 1)`.
4. Calculate the total number of slots required using the formula: `len(tasks) + number of idle slots`.
5. Return the maximum of `total slots` and `length of tasks`.

Here's the implementation of the `leastInterval` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        task_counts = [0] * 26  # To store the frequency of each task
        for task in tasks:
            task_counts[ord(task) - ord('A')] += 1
        
        max_freq = max(task_counts)  # Maximum frequency of any task
        max_freq_count = task_counts.count(max_freq)  # Number of tasks with maximum frequency
        
        # Calculate the number of idle slots between tasks
        # If n is less than the number of tasks with maximum frequency - 1,
        # then the number of idle slots should be at least (max_freq - 1) * (n + 1)
        idle_slots = max((max_freq - 1) * (n + 1), 0)
        
        # Calculate the total number of slots required
        total_slots = idle_slots + max_freq_count
        
        # Return the maximum of total slots and the length of tasks
        return max(total_slots, len(tasks))
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `leastInterval` method with the appropriate inputs to get the desired output. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
n = 2
result = solution.leastInterval(tasks, n)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```
