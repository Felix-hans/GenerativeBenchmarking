To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will preprocess the ancestors for each node up to a maximum depth of log(n) using the parent array. Then, for each query, we can use the preprocessed information to find the kth ancestor efficiently.

Here's the implementation of the `TreeAncestor` class in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class TreeAncestor:
    def __init__(self, n: int, parent: List[int]):
        self.max_depth = 16  # Assuming the maximum number of nodes is 2^16 = 65536
        self.dp = [[-1] * self.max_depth for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize the dp table

        # Preprocess the ancestors
        for node in range(n):
            self.dp[node][0] = parent[node]  # The 1st ancestor is the parent itself
            for depth in range(1, self.max_depth):
                if self.dp[node][depth-1] != -1:
                    parent_of_parent = self.dp[node][depth-1]
                    self.dp[node][depth] = self.dp[parent_of_parent][depth-1]

    def getKthAncestor(self, node: int, k: int) -> int:
        for depth in range(self.max_depth):
            if k & (1 << depth):
                if node == -1:
                    return -1
                node = self.dp[node][depth]

        return node
```

In the `__init__` method, we initialize the maximum depth to 16, assuming the maximum number of nodes is 65536 (2^16). We also initialize the dp table with -1 for all entries. Then, we preprocess the ancestors using the parent array and store the results in the dp table.

In the `getKthAncestor` method, we iterate through the bits of k from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If the current bit is set, we update the node to its kth ancestor at that depth. If the node becomes -1 at any point, it means there is no such ancestor, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the final node as the kth ancestor.

Here's an example usage of the `TreeAncestor` class:

```python
treeAncestor = TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2])
print(treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1))  # Output: 1
print(treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2))  # Output: 0
print(treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3))  # Output: -1
```

This will create a `TreeAncestor` object with 7 nodes and the given parent array. Then, it will perform three queries to find the kth ancestor for different nodes. The expected outputs are provided as comments.
