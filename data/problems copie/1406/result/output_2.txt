To determine the winner of the game, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll create a list `dp` to store the maximum score difference that can be achieved at each position in the `stoneValue` list.

Let's initialize `dp` with length `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `stoneValue`. We'll fill `dp` in reverse order, starting from the last position. For each position `i`, we'll consider all three possible moves (taking 1, 2, or 3 stones) and calculate the maximum score difference that can be achieved from that position.

Finally, we'll compare `dp[0]` with 0 to determine the winner. If it's greater than 0, Alice wins. If it's less than 0, Bob wins. Otherwise, it's a tie.

Here's the implementation of the `stoneGameIII` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def stoneGameIII(self, stoneValue: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(stoneValue)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            take = 0
            for j in range(i, min(i + 3, n)):
                take += stoneValue[j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], take - dp[j + 1])

        if dp[0] > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif dp[0] < 0:
            return "Bob"
        else:
            return "Tie"
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `stoneGameIII` function with your input to get the result. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
values = [1, 2, 3, 7]
result = solution.stoneGameIII(values)
print(result)  # Output: "Bob"
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
