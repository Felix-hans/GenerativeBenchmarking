To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy for both players. We'll create a memoization table to store the scores of each player at each position in the stoneValue array.

Here's the implementation of the `stoneGameIII` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def stoneGameIII(self, stoneValue: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(stoneValue)
        dp = [float('-inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[n] = 0

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            take = 0
            for j in range(i, min(n, i + 3)):
                take += stoneValue[j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], take - dp[j + 1])

        score = dp[0]
        if score > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif score < 0:
            return "Bob"
        else:
            return "Tie"
```

In this implementation, we initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` with size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the `stoneValue` array. The `dp` array stores the maximum score difference a player can achieve when starting from position `i`.

We iterate from the last stone position to the first stone position. For each position, we calculate the maximum score difference that can be achieved by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones. We update the `dp` array accordingly.

Finally, we check the score difference at the first position (`dp[0]`) to determine the winner. If the score is positive, Alice wins. If the score is negative, Bob wins. Otherwise, it's a tie.

Let's test the function with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

values = [1, 2, 3, 7]
print(solution.stoneGameIII(values))  # Output: "Bob"

values = [1, 2, 3, -9]
print(solution.stoneGameIII(values))  # Output: "Alice"

values = [1, 2, 3, 6]
print(solution.stoneGameIII(values))  # Output: "Tie"
```

The function returns the expected outputs for the given examples.
