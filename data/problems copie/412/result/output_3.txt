Here's the Python implementation of the given task:

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i % 3 == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("Buzz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
        return result
```

In this solution, we initialize an empty list `result` to store the output strings. We iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop. For each iteration, we check the divisibility of `i` by 3 and 5, 3 only, 5 only, or none of them using the modulo operator (`%`). Based on the conditions, we append the corresponding string to the `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list as the output.
