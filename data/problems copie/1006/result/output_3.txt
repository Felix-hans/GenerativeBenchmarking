To solve the given task in Python, you can use the following implementation of the `clumsy` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def clumsy(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        
        operations = ['*', '/', '+', '-']
        stack = [n]
        operation_index = 0
        
        for num in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            if operations[operation_index] == '*':
                stack[-1] *= num
            elif operations[operation_index] == '/':
                stack[-1] = int(stack[-1] / float(num))
            elif operations[operation_index] == '+':
                stack.append(num)
            elif operations[operation_index] == '-':
                stack.append(-num)
            
            operation_index = (operation_index + 1) % 4
        
        return sum(stack)
```

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the intermediate results. It iterates from `n-1` to `1` in a decreasing order and performs the corresponding operation based on the current index of the `operations` list. The index is incremented using modular arithmetic to cycle through the operations repeatedly. Finally, the sum of the values in the stack is returned as the result.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `clumsy` method on it with the desired `n` value to obtain the clumsy factorial. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 10
result = solution.clumsy(n)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
12
```

Note: The implementation handles the case when `n <= 2` separately since the pattern of operations only starts from `n = 3`.
