To solve the given task in Python, you can use the following implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def clumsy(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 2:
            return n
        
        if n <= 4:
            return n + 3
        
        if (n - 4) % 4 == 0:
            return n + 1
        
        if (n - 4) % 4 <= 2:
            return n + 2
        
        return n - 1
```

The solution uses a series of if statements to handle different cases based on the value of `n`. The logic is as follows:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the factorial is simply `n` itself.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 4, we add 3 to `n` to get the clumsy factorial.
3. If `(n - 4) % 4` is equal to 0, we add 1 to `n` to get the clumsy factorial. This condition handles cases where the remaining numbers after the first four numbers are divisible by 4.
4. If `(n - 4) % 4` is less than or equal to 2, we add 2 to `n` to get the clumsy factorial. This condition handles cases where the remaining numbers after the first four numbers leave a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 4.
5. For any other case, we subtract 1 from `n` to get the clumsy factorial.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `clumsy` method, passing the desired `n` as an argument to get the result. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.clumsy(4))  # Output: 7
print(solution.clumsy(10))  # Output: 12
```

This will print the clumsy factorial for the given `n` values.
