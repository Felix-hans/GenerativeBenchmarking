You can implement the task as follows in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class OrderedStream:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.stream = [None] * n  # Initialize the stream with None values
        self.ptr = 0  # Pointer to keep track of the next available index

    def insert(self, idKey: int, value: str) -> List[str]:
        idKey -= 1  # Convert idKey to 0-based index
        self.stream[idKey] = value  # Insert the value at the corresponding index

        if idKey == self.ptr:  # If the inserted idKey is the next expected one
            chunk = []
            while self.ptr < len(self.stream) and self.stream[self.ptr]:
                # Collect all the values from the current index onwards until a None value is encountered
                chunk.append(self.stream[self.ptr])
                self.ptr += 1  # Move the pointer to the next index

            return chunk

        return []  # If the inserted idKey is not the next expected one, return an empty list


# Example usage:
os = OrderedStream(5)
print(os.insert(3, "ccccc"))  # Output: []
print(os.insert(1, "aaaaa"))  # Output: ["aaaaa"]
print(os.insert(2, "bbbbb"))  # Output: ["bbbbb", "ccccc"]
print(os.insert(5, "eeeee"))  # Output: []
print(os.insert(4, "ddddd"))  # Output: ["ddddd", "eeeee"]
```

This implementation maintains an internal list called `stream` of size `n` to store the inserted values. The `ptr` variable keeps track of the next available index. When `insert` is called, it inserts the value at the corresponding index in the `stream` list. If the inserted idKey is the next expected one (determined by comparing it with the current value of `ptr`), it collects all the values from the current index onwards until a `None` value is encountered, and returns that chunk. Otherwise, it returns an empty list.

The example usage demonstrates how to create an instance of the `OrderedStream` class and call the `insert` method with different idKey and value pairs. The corresponding chunks are printed as output.
