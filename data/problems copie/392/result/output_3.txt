To check if a string `s` is a subsequence of string `t`, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's the implementation of the `isSubsequence` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True

        i = 0  # Pointer for string s
        j = 0  # Pointer for string t

        while j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
                if i == len(s):
                    return True
            j += 1

        return False
```

This implementation iterates over the characters of `t` and checks if each character matches the corresponding character in `s`. If a match is found, the pointer `i` for `s` is incremented. If all characters of `s` are found in order, it returns `True`, indicating that `s` is a subsequence of `t`. If we reach the end of `t` without finding all characters of `s`, it returns `False`.

To address the follow-up scenario where we have multiple strings `s1, s2, ..., sk` to check against `t`, we can optimize the solution by precomputing an index mapping for the characters in `t`. This index mapping will allow us to quickly find the next occurrence of a character in `t` when processing subsequent strings.

Here's an updated version of the code to handle the follow-up scenario efficiently:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Precompute index mapping for characters in t
        index_mapping = {}
        for i, char in enumerate(t):
            if char not in index_mapping:
                index_mapping[char] = []
            index_mapping[char].append(i)

        j = 0  # Pointer for string t

        for char in s:
            if char not in index_mapping:
                return False

            indices = index_mapping[char]
            # Binary search for the smallest index greater than or equal to j
            left, right = 0, len(indices) - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if indices[mid] < j:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1

            if left == len(indices):
                return False

            j = indices[left] + 1

        return True
```

In this updated version, we first precompute the index mapping for all characters in `t`. Then, for each character in `s`, we use binary search to find the smallest index in `t` that is greater than or equal to the current pointer `j`. If such an index is found, we update `j` to the next index and continue to the next character in `s`. If any character in `s` is not found or the indices are not in the correct order, it returns `False`. Otherwise, if all characters in `s` are found in order, it returns `True`.

This optimized approach reduces the time complexity when processing subsequent strings, making it more efficient for large values of `k`.
