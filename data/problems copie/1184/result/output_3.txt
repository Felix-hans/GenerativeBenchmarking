To find the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops on a circular bus route, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `total_distance` to store the total distance of the bus route.
2. Iterate over the `distance` list and calculate the `total_distance` by summing all the distances.
3. Initialize a variable `clockwise_distance` to store the distance traveled in the clockwise direction from start to destination.
4. If `start` is greater than `destination`, swap their values to ensure `start` is always smaller.
5. Iterate over the range from `start` to `destination` and calculate the `clockwise_distance` by summing the distances between the stops.
6. Calculate the `counterclockwise_distance` by subtracting `clockwise_distance` from `total_distance`.
7. Return the minimum of `clockwise_distance` and `counterclockwise_distance`.

Here's the implementation of the `distanceBetweenBusStops` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        total_distance = sum(distance)
        clockwise_distance = 0

        if start > destination:
            start, destination = destination, start

        for i in range(start, destination):
            clockwise_distance += distance[i]

        counterclockwise_distance = total_distance - clockwise_distance

        return min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `distanceBetweenBusStops` function with the given inputs to obtain the shortest distance between the start and destination stops.
