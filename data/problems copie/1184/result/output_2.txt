To find the shortest distance between two bus stops in a circular route, we can consider two scenarios: when the route is traversed clockwise and when it is traversed counterclockwise. We'll calculate the distance for both scenarios and return the minimum distance.

Here's the implementation of the `distanceBetweenBusStops` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        # Calculate total distance of the circular route
        total_distance = sum(distance)
        
        # Calculate the distance in clockwise direction
        if start <= destination:
            clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:destination])
        else:
            clockwise_distance = sum(distance[destination:start])
        
        # Calculate the distance in counterclockwise direction
        counterclockwise_distance = total_distance - clockwise_distance
        
        # Return the minimum distance
        return min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `distanceBetweenBusStops` method with the appropriate parameters to get the result.

Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
distance = [1, 2, 3, 4]
start = 0
destination = 1
result = solution.distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

Feel free to replace the `distance`, `start`, and `destination` variables with different values to test the function with other inputs.
