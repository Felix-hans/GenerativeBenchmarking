Here's the implementation of the `mostCommonWord` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List
import re
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        # Convert the paragraph to lowercase and split it into words
        words = re.findall(r'\w+', paragraph.lower())

        # Count the frequency of each word, excluding the banned words
        word_counts = Counter(word for word in words if word not in banned)

        # Find the most common word
        most_common_word = word_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]

        return most_common_word
```

To use this function, create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `mostCommonWord` method, passing the `paragraph` and `banned` as arguments.

Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
banned = ["hit"]
result = solution.mostCommonWord(paragraph, banned)
print(result)  # Output: "ball"
```

In this example, the most common word in the paragraph that is not in the banned list is "ball".
