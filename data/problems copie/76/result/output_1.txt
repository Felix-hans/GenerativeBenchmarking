To solve the problem, we can use the sliding window technique. Here's the Python implementation of the `minWindow` function:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return ""
        
        t_count = Counter(t)
        required_chars = len(t_count)
        
        window_start = 0
        window_chars = {}
        formed_chars = 0
        min_length = float('inf')
        result = ""
        
        for window_end in range(len(s)):
            right_char = s[window_end]
            window_chars[right_char] = window_chars.get(right_char, 0) + 1
            
            if right_char in t_count and window_chars[right_char] == t_count[right_char]:
                formed_chars += 1
            
            while formed_chars == required_chars and window_start <= window_end:
                left_char = s[window_start]
                
                if window_end - window_start + 1 < min_length:
                    min_length = window_end - window_start + 1
                    result = s[window_start:window_end+1]
                
                window_chars[left_char] -= 1
                if left_char in t_count and window_chars[left_char] < t_count[left_char]:
                    formed_chars -= 1
                
                window_start += 1
        
        return result
```

This solution maintains a sliding window defined by `window_start` and `window_end`. We keep track of the characters and their counts within the window using the `window_chars` dictionary. The `formed_chars` variable keeps track of the number of unique characters from `t` that are present in the window.

We iterate through the string `s`, expanding the window from the right (`window_end`) and updating the `window_chars` and `formed_chars` accordingly. Whenever we have all the required characters in the window, we try to contract the window from the left (`window_start`) to find a potentially smaller window.

At each step, if we find a window with a smaller length than the current minimum, we update `min_length` and `result` with the new window substring. Finally, we return the `result` string, which represents the minimum window substring that contains all the characters from `t`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`, respectively.
