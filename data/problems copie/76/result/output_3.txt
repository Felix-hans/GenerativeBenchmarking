To solve the problem, we can use the sliding window technique. Here's the implementation of the `minWindow` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a dictionary to store the character frequencies in string t
        target_freq = {}
        for char in t:
            target_freq[char] = target_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
        
        # Initialize variables for the sliding window
        window_start = 0
        window_end = 0
        window_freq = {}
        formed = 0  # Number of characters in t that have been formed in the window
        
        # Initialize variables for tracking the minimum window substring
        min_window_length = float('inf')
        min_window_start = 0
        
        while window_end < len(s):
            # Expand the window by including the current character
            char = s[window_end]
            window_freq[char] = window_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
            
            # If the current character is in t and its frequency in the window
            # matches or exceeds its frequency in t, increment the formed count
            if char in target_freq and window_freq[char] <= target_freq[char]:
                formed += 1
            
            # Try to minimize the window by contracting from the left
            while formed == len(t):
                # Update the minimum window substring if necessary
                if window_end - window_start + 1 < min_window_length:
                    min_window_length = window_end - window_start + 1
                    min_window_start = window_start
                
                # Contract the window from the left
                char = s[window_start]
                window_freq[char] -= 1
                
                # If the character is in t and its frequency in the window
                # becomes less than its frequency in t, decrement the formed count
                if char in target_freq and window_freq[char] < target_freq[char]:
                    formed -= 1
                
                window_start += 1  # Move the window start to the right
            
            window_end += 1  # Move the window end to the right
        
        if min_window_length == float('inf'):
            return ""
        
        return s[min_window_start:min_window_start + min_window_length]
```

The algorithm works by maintaining two windows: the overall window (defined by `window_start` and `window_end`) and the minimum window substring (defined by `min_window_start` and `min_window_length`). 

We iterate through the string `s` using the `window_end` pointer. At each step, we expand the window by including the current character. If the current character is in `t` and its frequency in the window matches or exceeds its frequency in `t`, we increment the `formed` count.

If the `formed` count equals the length of `t`, it means we have a potential window that includes all characters from `t`. We then try to minimize this window by contracting it from the left using the `window_start` pointer. While the window still satisfies the condition of including all characters from `t`, we keep contracting it and update the minimum window substring if necessary.

Finally, we return the minimum window substring, or an empty string if no such substring exists.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`, respectively. This is because we iterate through both strings once, and the two pointers (`window_start` and `window_end`) traverse the string `s` only once.
