To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array `nums` and maintain a sliding window of size `indexDiff`. For each element `nums[i]`, we check if there exists any element within the sliding window that satisfies the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff`. If such a pair exists, we return `True`. Otherwise, we continue iterating through the array.

Here's the implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], indexDiff: int, valueDiff: int) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        
        window = {}  # Sliding window of size indexDiff
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Check if there is an element in the window that satisfies the condition
            for j in range(max(0, i - indexDiff), i):
                if abs(nums[i] - window[j]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
            
            # Add the current element to the window
            window[i] = nums[i]
            
            # Remove the element that falls outside the window
            if i >= indexDiff:
                del window[i - indexDiff]
        
        return False
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function with the given inputs:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
indexDiff = 3
valueDiff = 0

solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

```python
nums = [1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9]
indexDiff = 2
valueDiff = 3

solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

The first example will return `True` because there exists a pair of indices `(0, 3)` that satisfies the given conditions. The second example will return `False` as there is no such pair.
