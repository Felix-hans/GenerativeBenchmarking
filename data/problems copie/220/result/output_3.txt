To solve this task, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window of size `indexDiff` and check if the absolute difference between any two elements within this window is less than or equal to `valueDiff`.

Here's the implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums, indexDiff, valueDiff):
        n = len(nums)
        window = {}
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Check if the absolute difference between any two elements within the window is <= valueDiff
            for j in range(max(0, i - indexDiff), i):
                if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
            
            # Add the current element to the window
            window[nums[i]] = window.get(nums[i], 0) + 1
            
            # Remove the oldest element from the window if the window size exceeds indexDiff
            if i >= indexDiff:
                window[nums[i - indexDiff]] -= 1
                if window[nums[i - indexDiff]] == 0:
                    del window[nums[i - indexDiff]]
        
        return False
```

Let's test the implementation using the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
indexDiff = 3
valueDiff = 0
print(solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff))
# Output: True

# Example 2
nums = [1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9]
indexDiff = 2
valueDiff = 3
print(solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff))
# Output: False
```

The implementation should return the expected results for the given examples.
