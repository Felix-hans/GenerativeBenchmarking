Here's an implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums, indexDiff, valueDiff):
        n = len(nums)
        buckets = {}
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the bucket index
            bucket = nums[i] // (valueDiff + 1)
            
            # Check if the current bucket or neighboring buckets have a value within the valueDiff range
            for j in range(bucket - 1, bucket + 2):
                if j in buckets and abs(nums[i] - buckets[j]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
            
            # Update the bucket with the current value
            buckets[bucket] = nums[i]
            
            # Remove the outdated bucket if the index difference exceeds indexDiff
            if i >= indexDiff:
                outdated_bucket = nums[i - indexDiff] // (valueDiff + 1)
                del buckets[outdated_bucket]
        
        return False
```

Explanation:
1. We initialize an empty dictionary `buckets` to store the bucket index as the key and the corresponding value as the value.
2. We iterate through the input array `nums` using a for loop and perform the following steps:
   - Calculate the bucket index by dividing the current element by `valueDiff + 1`.
   - Check if the current bucket or neighboring buckets (within a range of Â±1) have a value that satisfies the `valueDiff` condition. If we find a match, we return True.
   - Update the bucket with the current element's value in the `buckets` dictionary.
   - If the current index exceeds `indexDiff`, we remove the outdated bucket from the `buckets` dictionary to maintain a sliding window of size `indexDiff`.
3. If we don't find any matching pairs that satisfy all the conditions, we return False.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` method to test it with different inputs.
