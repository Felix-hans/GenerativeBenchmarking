To maximize the sum of the minimum values in pairs, we need to pair the numbers such that the difference between the values in each pair is minimized. By doing so, we can ensure that the smaller numbers are paired with each other, leaving the larger numbers to contribute more to the sum.

Here's the implementation of the `arrayPairSum` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        max_sum = 0
        
        # Pair the numbers and add the minimum value of each pair to the sum
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
            max_sum += nums[i]
        
        return max_sum
```

The function sorts the `nums` array in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it iterates over the sorted array with a step size of 2 (i.e., considering pairs of elements). It adds the minimum value of each pair to the `max_sum` variable. Finally, it returns the `max_sum` as the result.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `arrayPairSum` method with the input array `nums` to get the maximized sum. Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 4, 3, 2]
max_sum = solution.arrayPairSum(nums)
print(max_sum)  # Output: 4
```

This will output `4` as the maximum possible sum for the given input array `nums`.
