You can solve the problem using a recursive approach. Here's the Python implementation for the given task:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}  # Memoization dictionary to store already computed results
        
        def eatOranges(n: int) -> int:
            if n <= 1:
                return n
            
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]
            
            # Option 1: Eat one orange
            days = 1 + eatOranges(n - 1)
            
            # Option 2: Eat n/2 oranges if n is divisible by 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                days = min(days, 1 + eatOranges(n // 2))
            
            # Option 3: Eat 2*(n/3) oranges if n is divisible by 3
            if n % 3 == 0:
                days = min(days, 1 + eatOranges(n // 3 * 2))
            
            memo[n] = days  # Store the result in the memoization dictionary
            return days
        
        return eatOranges(n)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minDays` function, passing the value of `n` as an argument. The function will return the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges according to the given rules.

Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 10
result = solution.minDays(n)
print(result)  # Output: 4
```

Similarly, you can test the function with other values of `n` to get the corresponding minimum number of days.
