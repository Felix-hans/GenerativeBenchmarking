To solve the given task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Convert all the points' coordinates from (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, theta) relative to the location. This will help us calculate the angles later.
2. Initialize a variable `max_points` to keep track of the maximum number of points visible.
3. Count the number of points at the current location and assign it to `max_points`.
4. Create an empty list `angles` to store all the angles formed by the points relative to the east direction.
5. Iterate over each point and calculate its angle relative to the east direction. Add this angle to the `angles` list.
6. Sort the `angles` list in ascending order.
7. Concatenate the `angles` list with itself to handle circular cases when the field of view wraps around from 360 degrees to 0 degrees.
8. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both pointing to the beginning of the `angles` list.
9. Iterate while the `start` pointer is less than the length of the `angles` list:
   - While the angle between the `start` and `end` pointers is less than or equal to the given `angle`, increment the `end` pointer.
   - Update the `max_points` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and the difference between `end` and `start`.
   - Increment the `start` pointer.
10. Return the `max_points` as the maximum number of points visible.

Here's the implementation of the `visiblePoints` method in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        def calculate_angle(x, y):
            dx = x - location[0]
            dy = y - location[1]
            return math.atan2(dy, dx) * (180 / math.pi)

        polar_points = []
        max_points = 0
        same_location = 0

        for point in points:
            x, y = point
            if x == location[0] and y == location[1]:
                same_location += 1
            else:
                polar_points.append(calculate_angle(x, y))

        polar_points.sort()
        polar_points += [angle + polar_point for polar_point in polar_points]

        start = 0
        for end in range(len(polar_points)):
            while polar_points[end] - polar_points[start] > angle:
                start += 1
            max_points = max(max_points, end - start + 1)

        return max_points + same_location
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `visiblePoints` method with the given inputs to get the maximum number of points visible.
