To solve this task, we can use the union-find algorithm to find the largest connected component in the given graph. Here's the implementation of the `largestComponentSize` function using the provided `Solution` class:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestComponentSize(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Function to find the parent of a number
        def find(x):
            if parents[x] != x:
                parents[x] = find(parents[x])
            return parents[x]

        # Function to union two numbers
        def union(x, y):
            root_x, root_y = find(x), find(y)
            if root_x != root_y:
                parents[root_x] = root_y
                sizes[root_y] += sizes[root_x]

        # Initialize parents and sizes arrays
        max_num = max(nums)
        parents = list(range(max_num + 1))
        sizes = [1] * (max_num + 1)

        # Iterate over each number and union it with its factors
        for num in nums:
            for factor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
                if num % factor == 0:
                    union(num, factor)
                    union(num, num // factor)

        # Find the maximum size among all connected components
        max_size = max(sizes)

        return max_size
```

This solution uses two helper functions: `find` and `union`. The `find` function finds the parent of a number while applying path compression, and the `union` function unions two numbers by updating their parent and size information.

In the main function, we initialize the `parents` and `sizes` arrays. Then, we iterate over each number in `nums` and for each number, we find its factors and union it with them. Finally, we return the maximum size among all connected components, which represents the largest connected component in the graph.
