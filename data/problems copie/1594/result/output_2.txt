To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll create two 2D arrays to keep track of the maximum positive and negative products at each cell in the grid. Let's define `max_pos[i][j]` as the maximum positive product and `max_neg[i][j]` as the maximum negative product when reaching cell (i, j).

We'll initialize `max_pos` and `max_neg` with the first cell's value, i.e., `max_pos[0][0] = max_neg[0][0] = grid[0][0]`. Then, we'll fill in the values for the first row and the first column by multiplying the previous cell's value with the current cell's value.

Next, we'll iterate through the remaining cells of the grid and update `max_pos` and `max_neg` based on the neighboring cells' values. For each cell (i, j), we'll update `max_pos[i][j]` and `max_neg[i][j]` as follows:

- If grid[i][j] is positive, we can update `max_pos[i][j]` by taking the maximum of `max_pos[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]` (coming from above) and `max_pos[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]` (coming from the left). Similarly, we update `max_neg[i][j]` by taking the minimum of `max_neg[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]` and `max_neg[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]`.

- If grid[i][j] is negative, we can update `max_pos[i][j]` by taking the minimum of `max_neg[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]` and `max_neg[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]`. Similarly, we update `max_neg[i][j]` by taking the maximum of `max_pos[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]` and `max_pos[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]`.

Finally, the maximum non-negative product will be stored in `max_pos[m-1][n-1]`. If it is negative, we return -1; otherwise, we return the product modulo 10^9 + 7.

Here's the implementation of the `maxProductPath` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProductPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        max_pos = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        max_neg = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        max_pos[0][0] = max_neg[0][0] = grid[0][0]

        # Initialize the first row
        for j in range(1, n):
            max_pos[0][j] = max_pos[0][j-1] * grid[0][j]
            max_neg[0][j] = max_neg[0][j-1] * grid[0][j]

        # Initialize the first column
        for i in range(1, m):
            max_pos[i][0] = max_pos[i-1][0] * grid[i][0]
            max_neg[i][0] = max_neg[i-1][0] * grid[i][0]

        # Fill in the values for the remaining cells
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if grid[i][j] >= 0:
                    max_pos[i
