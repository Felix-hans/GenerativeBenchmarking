You can solve the problem using dynamic programming. Here's one way to implement the `shortestCommonSupersequence` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        
        # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the shortest common supersequences
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the dp array using dynamic programming
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        # Reconstruct the shortest common supersequence
        supersequence = ""
        i, j = m, n
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
                supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
            else:
                supersequence = str2[j - 1] + supersequence
                j -= 1
        
        # Add the remaining characters from str1 or str2
        while i > 0:
            supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
            i -= 1
        while j > 0:
            supersequence = str2[j - 1] + supersequence
            j -= 1
        
        return supersequence
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `shortestCommonSupersequence` method on it to find the shortest common supersequence of `str1` and `str2`. Here's an example:

```python
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2)
print(result)  # Output: "cabac"
```

Note that this implementation returns one of the valid shortest common supersequences if there are multiple possibilities.
