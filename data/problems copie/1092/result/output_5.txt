Here's the implementation of the `shortestCommonSupersequence` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        
        # Create a table to store the lengths of the longest common subsequence
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Calculate the lengths of the longest common subsequence
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        # Construct the shortest common supersequence using the lengths of the longest common subsequence
        superseq = ''
        i, j = m, n
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                superseq = str1[i - 1] + superseq
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
                superseq = str1[i - 1] + superseq
                i -= 1
            else:
                superseq = str2[j - 1] + superseq
                j -= 1
        
        # Add remaining characters from str1
        while i > 0:
            superseq = str1[i - 1] + superseq
            i -= 1
        
        # Add remaining characters from str2
        while j > 0:
            superseq = str2[j - 1] + superseq
            j -= 1
        
        return superseq
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `shortestCommonSupersequence` method to get the shortest common supersequence for the given input strings. Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
result = solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
cabac
```

Note that there can be multiple valid shortest common supersequences, and this solution returns one of them.
