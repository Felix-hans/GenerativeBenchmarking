To solve this task, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array using a dictionary.
2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted frequencies and keep removing integers until at least half of the integers have been removed.
4. Return the number of integers removed.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` method in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = {}  # Dictionary to store the frequency of integers
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

        sorted_freq = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)  # Sort frequencies in descending order

        count = 0  # Number of integers removed
        removed = 0  # Total number of integers removed
        half_len = len(arr) // 2

        for f in sorted_freq:
            count += 1
            removed += f
            if removed >= half_len:
                break

        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` method with the input array to get the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed. For example:

```python
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

The code will print the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed, which is 2 in this case.
