To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the array.
2. Sort the frequencies in descending order.
3. Iterate over the sorted frequencies and keep removing integers until at least half of the integers are removed.
4. Return the number of integers removed.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each integer
        freq = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        # Step 2: Sort the frequencies in descending order
        sorted_freq = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
        
        # Step 3: Remove integers until at least half of the integers are removed
        removed = 0
        count = 0
        for f in sorted_freq:
            count += f
            removed += 1
            if count >= len(arr) // 2:
                break
        
        # Step 4: Return the number of integers removed
        return removed
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` function with the input array to get the minimum size of the set that needs to be removed. For example:

```python
arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 7]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.minSetSize(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```
