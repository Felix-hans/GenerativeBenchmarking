To solve this problem, we can follow the traditional binary addition algorithm with a few modifications to handle negative base -2 numbers.

Here's the Python implementation of the `addNegabinary` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def addNegabinary(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        carry = 0
        i = len(arr1) - 1
        j = len(arr2) - 1

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            if i >= 0:
                carry += arr1[i]
                i -= 1
            if j >= 0:
                carry += arr2[j]
                j -= 1

            # Calculate the current digit and the carry for the next iteration
            result.append(carry & 1)  # Append the least significant bit
            carry = -(carry >> 1)    # Update the carry for the next iteration

        # Remove leading zeros in the result array
        while len(result) > 1 and result[-1] == 0:
            result.pop()

        # Reverse the result array to get the correct order
        result.reverse()
        return result
```

Explanation:
1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the result.
2. Initialize a variable `carry` to keep track of the carry during addition. Initialize it to 0.
3. Start iterating from the rightmost bit of both `arr1` and `arr2` (i.e., from the least significant bit).
4. While iterating, perform the following steps:
   - Add the corresponding bits of `arr1` and `arr2` to the `carry`.
   - Append the least significant bit of the `carry` to the `result`.
   - Update the `carry` for the next iteration by shifting it right by 1 and negating it.
   - Decrement the indices `i` and `j` to move to the next bit of `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.
5. After the iteration, there might be a remaining carry. Add it to the `result`.
6. Remove any leading zeros from the `result` array.
7. Reverse the `result` array to get the correct order.
8. Return the `result`.

This algorithm handles the addition of negative base -2 numbers by using bitwise operations to calculate the digits and carries.
