To generate a valid n-bit gray code sequence, we can use a recursive algorithm. The idea is to generate the gray code sequence for n-1 bits and then append the reverse of the sequence with an additional bit.

Here's the implementation of the `grayCode` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        
        prev_sequence = self.grayCode(n - 1)
        mask = 1 << (n - 1)  # Create a mask to toggle the additional bit
        
        # Append the reverse of the previous sequence with an additional bit
        return prev_sequence + [num | mask for num in reversed(prev_sequence)]
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `grayCode` function to generate a valid n-bit gray code sequence. Here's an example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 2
sequence = solution.grayCode(n)
print(sequence)  # Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
```

The above code will generate a valid 2-bit gray code sequence as requested in the example.
