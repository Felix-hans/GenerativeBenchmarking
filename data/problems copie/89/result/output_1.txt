One way to generate a valid n-bit gray code sequence is by using the following algorithm:

1. Create an empty list to store the gray code sequence.
2. Append 0 to the list as the first integer.
3. Initialize a variable `mask` to 1. This mask will be used to toggle the bit at a specific position.
4. Iterate `i` from 0 to n-1.
    1. Iterate `j` in reverse order from the current size of the gray code sequence - 1 to 0.
        1. Compute the next gray code by toggling the bit at position `i` using `mask`.
        2. Append the next gray code to the gray code sequence.
    2. Update the mask by left-shifting it by 1.
5. Return the gray code sequence.

Here's the implementation of the `grayCode` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        gray_code = [0]  # Initialize with 0
        mask = 1  # Initialize mask

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(len(gray_code) - 1, -1, -1):
                next_gray_code = gray_code[j] | mask  # Toggle the bit at position i
                gray_code.append(next_gray_code)

            mask <<= 1  # Update the mask by left-shifting

        return gray_code
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `grayCode` function with the desired `n` value to get a valid n-bit gray code sequence. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 2
sequence = solution.grayCode(n)
print(sequence)  # Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
```
