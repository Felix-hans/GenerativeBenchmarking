To generate a valid n-bit gray code sequence, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Here's the implementation of the `grayCode` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        
        result = []
        visited = set()
        self.backtrack(n, 0, visited, result)
        return result
    
    def backtrack(self, n: int, num: int, visited: set, result: List[int]):
        result.append(num)
        visited.add(num)
        
        for i in range(n):
            next_num = num ^ (1 << i)  # Flipping one bit at a time
            if next_num not in visited:
                self.backtrack(n, next_num, visited, result)
                break
                
solution = Solution()
n = 2
print(solution.grayCode(n))  # Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
```

The `grayCode` function initializes an empty `result` list and a set called `visited` to keep track of the visited integers. It then calls the `backtrack` function to generate the gray code sequence.

The `backtrack` function takes the current number (`num`), the set of visited numbers (`visited`), and the `result` list as parameters. It appends the current number to the result and adds it to the visited set. Then, it iterates over each bit position (`i`) from 0 to `n-1` and calculates the next number by flipping the bit at position `i` using the XOR operator (`^`). If the next number is not visited, it recursively calls the `backtrack` function with the next number and continues the backtracking process. The break statement ensures that only one valid next number is considered for each iteration.

Finally, we create an instance of the `Solution` class, set the value of `n` to 2 (as in the first example), and print the result.

Running the code will output `[0, 1, 3, 2]`, which is a valid 2-bit gray code sequence.
