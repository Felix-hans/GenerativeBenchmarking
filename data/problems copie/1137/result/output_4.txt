To implement the Tribonacci sequence in Python, you can use a simple iterative approach or a recursive function. Here's an implementation using a recursive function:

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1 or n == 2:
            return 1
        else:
            return self.tribonacci(n - 1) + self.tribonacci(n - 2) + self.tribonacci(n - 3)
```

This solution checks the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2, and then recursively calculates the Tribonacci value for n >= 3 by summing the three previous Tribonacci numbers.

You can test the solution with the given examples or additional test cases:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.tribonacci(4))  # Output: 4
print(solution.tribonacci(25))  # Output: 1389537
```

The solution should return the expected output for each test case.
