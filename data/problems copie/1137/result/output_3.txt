To solve the task of finding the Tribonacci sequence value for a given input `n` in Python, you can use a simple iterative approach. Here's the implementation of the `tribonacci` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1 or n == 2:
            return 1

        a, b, c = 0, 1, 1
        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c

        return c
```

The function starts by handling the base cases. If `n` is 0, it directly returns 0. If `n` is 1 or 2, it returns 1 since those are the initial values in the Tribonacci sequence.

For `n` greater than 2, the function uses three variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) to store the three most recent values in the sequence. It then iteratively calculates the next value by updating these variables based on the Tribonacci recurrence relation: `Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `c`, which corresponds to the `n`th term in the Tribonacci sequence.

Here's an example usage of the `tribonacci` function:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.tribonacci(4))  # Output: 4
print(solution.tribonacci(25))  # Output: 1389537
```

The function should correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence value for the given input `n`.
