To implement the task in Python, you can use a set to keep track of unique elements in the array. As you iterate through the array, if you encounter an element that is already in the set, it means it appears at least twice, and you can return True. If you finish iterating through the array without finding any duplicates, you can return False.

Here's the implementation of the `containsDuplicate` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        num_set = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in num_set:
                return True
            num_set.add(num)
        return False
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `containsDuplicate` method, passing in the `nums` array as an argument. It will return True if there are any duplicates in the array, and False otherwise.

Example usage:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsDuplicate(nums)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsDuplicate(nums)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

```python
nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsDuplicate(nums)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
