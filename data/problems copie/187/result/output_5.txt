Certainly! Here's an implementation of the `findRepeatedDnaSequences` function in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        sequences = defaultdict(int)  # Store the count of each 10-letter sequence
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 9):
            sequence = s[i:i+10]  # Get the current 10-letter sequence
            
            # Increment the count of the sequence
            sequences[sequence] += 1
            
            # Check if the sequence occurs more than once
            if sequences[sequence] == 2:
                result.append(sequence)
        
        return result
```

This solution utilizes a sliding window approach to iterate over the DNA sequence `s` and maintain a count of each 10-letter sequence encountered. The `defaultdict` data structure is used to conveniently initialize the count of any unseen sequence to zero. Whenever a sequence is encountered for the second time, it is added to the `result` list.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `findRepeatedDnaSequences` method, passing the DNA sequence as an argument. The method will return a list of all the 10-letter sequences that occur more than once in the DNA molecule.
