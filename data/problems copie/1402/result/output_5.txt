To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll sort the dishes' satisfaction levels in descending order and then iterate through the sorted list. 

In each iteration, we'll calculate the like-time coefficient for the current dish by multiplying its satisfaction level with the time taken for all previous dishes. We'll keep track of the maximum like-time coefficient obtained so far. 

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort dishes in descending order
        n = len(satisfaction)
        max_like_time = 0
        curr_time = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if curr_time + satisfaction[i] <= 0:
                break  # Stop if adding the next dish makes the like-time coefficient negative
            curr_time += satisfaction[i]
            max_like_time += curr_time
        
        return max_like_time
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxSatisfaction` function, passing the satisfaction list as the argument. For example:

```python
s = Solution()
satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
max_like_time = s.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction)
print(max_like_time)  # Output: 14
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
