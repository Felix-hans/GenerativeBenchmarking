To solve the problem, we can consider two scenarios:

1. If k is greater than 1, we can rearrange the characters of the string in any order to get the lexicographically smallest string. This is because we can choose any character at any position and move it to the end repeatedly until we reach the desired order. In this case, we can simply sort the string and return the result.

2. If k is equal to 1, we need to consider all possible rotations of the string and select the lexicographically smallest one. We can achieve this by comparing the string with all its rotations and keeping track of the smallest string found so far.

Here's the implementation of the `orderlyQueue` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k > 1:
            return ''.join(sorted(s))
        
        smallest = s
        for i in range(len(s)):
            rotated = s[i:] + s[:i]
            if rotated < smallest:
                smallest = rotated
        
        return smallest
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `orderlyQueue` method with the given input to get the desired output. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "baaca"
k = 3
result = solution.orderlyQueue(s, k)
print(result)  # Output: "aaabc"
```

The code will output the lexicographically smallest string based on the given input.
