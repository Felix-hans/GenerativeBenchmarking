Here's the implementation of the `orderlyQueue` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k == 1:
            # If k is 1, we can only rotate the string.
            # We iterate through all possible rotations and keep track of the lexicographically smallest string.
            n = len(s)
            smallest = s
            for _ in range(n):
                s = s[1:] + s[0]
                if s < smallest:
                    smallest = s
            return smallest
        else:
            # If k is greater than 1, we can sort the string directly.
            return "".join(sorted(s))
```

This function checks whether `k` is equal to 1 or not. If `k` is 1, it iterates through all possible rotations of the string `s` and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest string. If `k` is greater than 1, it sorts the string directly using the `sorted` function and returns the result.
