To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to store and reuse the results of subproblems. We'll define a recursive function `dfs` that takes a cell's coordinates and returns the length of the longest increasing path starting from that cell. We'll also use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's the implementation of the `longestIncreasingPath` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not matrix:
            return 0

        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        cache = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        max_length = 0

        def dfs(i, j):
            if cache[i][j] != 0:
                return cache[i][j]

            directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
            for dx, dy in directions:
                x, y = i + dx, j + dy
                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and matrix[x][y] > matrix[i][j]:
                    cache[i][j] = max(cache[i][j], dfs(x, y))

            cache[i][j] += 1
            return cache[i][j]

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                max_length = max(max_length, dfs(i, j))

        return max_length
```

Now we can test the solution using the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

matrix1 = [[9, 9, 4], [6, 6, 8], [2, 1, 1]]
print(solution.longestIncreasingPath(matrix1))  # Output: 4

matrix2 = [[3, 4, 5], [3, 2, 6], [2, 2, 1]]
print(solution.longestIncreasingPath(matrix2))  # Output: 4

matrix3 = [[1]]
print(solution.longestIncreasingPath(matrix3))  # Output: 1
```

The output will match the expected results:

```
4
4
1
```
