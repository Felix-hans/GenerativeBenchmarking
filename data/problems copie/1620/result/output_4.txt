To solve this task, we can follow the given steps:

1. Create a helper function `calculate_quality` that takes the tower's coordinates, quality factor, and a coordinate (x, y) as parameters. This function calculates and returns the signal quality of the tower at the given coordinate.

2. Initialize variables `max_quality` and `best_coordinate` to keep track of the maximum network quality and the best coordinate found so far. Set `max_quality` to 0 and `best_coordinate` to None initially.

3. Iterate over all possible coordinates within the range defined by the radius. We can start from x = 0 and y = 0 and go up to x = 50 and y = 50.

4. For each coordinate, iterate over all the towers and calculate the signal quality of each tower at the current coordinate using the `calculate_quality` helper function. Sum up these signal qualities to get the network quality at the current coordinate.

5. If the current network quality is greater than the maximum quality (`network_quality > max_quality`), update `max_quality` and `best_coordinate` to the current network quality and coordinate.

6. If the current network quality is equal to the maximum quality (`network_quality == max_quality`), compare the current coordinate with the best coordinate lexicographically. If the current coordinate is lexicographically smaller, update `best_coordinate` to the current coordinate.

7. After the loops, return the `best_coordinate` as the result.

Here's the implementation of the `bestCoordinate` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def bestCoordinate(self, towers: List[List[int]], radius: int) -> List[int]:
        def calculate_quality(x1, y1, quality, x2, y2):
            distance = ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5
            return quality // (1 + distance)

        max_quality = 0
        best_coordinate = None

        for x in range(51):
            for y in range(51):
                network_quality = 0
                for tower in towers:
                    tower_x, tower_y, quality = tower
                    if ((tower_x - x) ** 2 + (tower_y - y) ** 2) ** 0.5 <= radius:
                        network_quality += calculate_quality(tower_x, tower_y, quality, x, y)

                if network_quality > max_quality:
                    max_quality = network_quality
                    best_coordinate = [x, y]
                elif network_quality == max_quality:
                    if best_coordinate is None or (x < best_coordinate[0]) or (x == best_coordinate[0] and y < best_coordinate[1]):
                        best_coordinate = [x, y]

        return best_coordinate
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `bestCoordinate` method with the input towers and radius to obtain the result.
