To solve the given task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum network quality and the corresponding coordinate.
2. Iterate through all possible coordinates within the given radius.
3. For each coordinate, calculate the network quality by iterating through all the towers and summing up the signal qualities of reachable towers.
4. If the calculated network quality is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum quality and the corresponding coordinate.
5. If the calculated network quality is equal to the current maximum, compare the coordinate lexicographically and update if it is smaller.
6. Finally, return the coordinate with the maximum network quality.

Here's the implementation of the `bestCoordinate` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def bestCoordinate(self, towers: List[List[int]], radius: int) -> List[int]:
        max_quality = 0
        best_coordinate = [0, 0]

        for x in range(51):
            for y in range(51):
                network_quality = 0

                for tower in towers:
                    tx, ty, tq = tower
                    distance = ((tx - x) ** 2 + (ty - y) ** 2) ** 0.5

                    if distance <= radius:
                        signal_quality = tq // (1 + distance)
                        network_quality += signal_quality

                if network_quality > max_quality:
                    max_quality = network_quality
                    best_coordinate = [x, y]
                elif network_quality == max_quality:
                    if (x < best_coordinate[0]) or (x == best_coordinate[0] and y < best_coordinate[1]):
                        best_coordinate = [x, y]

        return best_coordinate
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `bestCoordinate` method with the given input to test it out. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
towers = [[1, 2, 5], [2, 1, 7], [3, 1, 9]]
radius = 2
result = solution.bestCoordinate(towers, radius)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 1]
```

The above code will print the expected output `[2, 1]` for the given example.
