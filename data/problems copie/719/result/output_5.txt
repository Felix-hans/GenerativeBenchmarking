To solve this task, we can use a binary search algorithm combined with a sliding window approach.

Here's the implementation of the `smallestDistancePair` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order

        # Define the search space
        left = 0
        right = nums[-1] - nums[0]

        # Perform binary search
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = 0
            start = 0

            # Count the number of pairs with distance <= mid
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                while nums[i] - nums[start] > mid:
                    start += 1
                count += i - start

            # Adjust the search space based on the count
            if count >= k:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return left
```

Let's go through the code:

1. We start by sorting the `nums` array in ascending order to simplify the search process.

2. We define the search space using the minimum and maximum possible distances between pairs in the sorted array.

3. We perform binary search by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and counting the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to the midpoint.

4. The count is updated using a sliding window approach. We maintain a `start` pointer that points to the beginning of the window, and we move the `i` pointer from the start to the end of the array. If the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[start]` exceeds the midpoint, we increment the `start` pointer until the difference is within the allowed range.

5. After counting the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to the midpoint, we adjust the search space based on the count. If the count is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the `k`th smallest distance is within the current search space, so we update `right` to the midpoint. Otherwise, the `k`th smallest distance is outside the current search space, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`.

6. We repeat steps 3-5 until the search space is reduced to a single value (`left = right`). At this point, the value of `left` represents the `k`th smallest distance.

Finally, we return the value of `left` as the result.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `smallestDistancePair` method to test the implementation with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.smallestDistancePair([1, 3, 1], 1))  # Output: 0
print(solution.smallestDistancePair([1, 1, 1], 2))  # Output: 0
print(solution.smallestDistancePair([1, 6, 1], 3))  # Output: 5
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
