To solve this task, we can use the greedy approach. We need to sort the tasks in descending order based on the difference between the actual energy required and the minimum energy required for each task. This way, we prioritize tasks with higher differences, as they require more initial energy.

Here's the implementation of the `minimumEffort` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumEffort(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
        total_energy = 0
        initial_energy = 0

        for actual, minimum in tasks:
            if initial_energy < minimum:
                diff = minimum - initial_energy
                total_energy += diff
                initial_energy += diff
            initial_energy -= actual

        return total_energy
```

Let's test the function using the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
tasks = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 8

# Example 2
tasks = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [10, 11], [10, 12], [8, 9]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 32

# Example 3
tasks = [[1, 7], [2, 8], [3, 9], [4, 10], [5, 11], [6, 12]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 27
```

The function should return the expected outputs for the given examples.
