To solve the given task, we can use the following approach:

1. Sort both arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, in non-decreasing order.
2. Create an empty dictionary, `advantage`, to store the advantage count for each element in `nums2`.
3. Create two lists, `remaining` and `assigned`, to keep track of the remaining numbers in `nums1` and the assigned numbers in the advantage permutation, respectively. Initialize both lists with the values from `nums1`.
4. Iterate through each element, `num`, in `nums2`, and do the following:
   - If `num` is smaller than the smallest number in `remaining`, assign the smallest number to `num` in `advantage`.
   - Otherwise, find the smallest number, `assigned_num`, in `assigned` that is greater than `num`. Assign `assigned_num` to `num` in `advantage` and remove `assigned_num` from `assigned`.
5. Create a list, `result`, to store the final advantage permutation.
6. Iterate through each element, `num`, in `nums2`, and do the following:
   - If `num` is present in `advantage`, append the corresponding value from `advantage` to `result` and remove the entry from `advantage`.
   - Otherwise, append the smallest number from `remaining` to `result` and remove it from `remaining`.
7. Return the `result` list as the maximum advantage permutation.

Here's the implementation of the `advantageCount` method in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def advantageCount(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums1.sort()
        nums2_sort = sorted([(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums2)])
        advantage = {}
        remaining = list(nums1)
        assigned = []
        
        for num, i in nums2_sort:
            if num < remaining[0]:
                advantage[i] = remaining[0]
                remaining.pop(0)
            else:
                assigned_num = next((n for n in remaining if n > num), remaining[0])
                advantage[i] = assigned_num
                remaining.remove(assigned_num)
                assigned.append(assigned_num)
        
        result = [advantage[i] if i in advantage else remaining.pop(0) for i in range(len(nums2))]
        return result
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `advantageCount` method with the given inputs to get the desired output. Here's an example:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
nums2 = [1, 10, 4, 11]
output = solution.advantageCount(nums1, nums2)
print(output)  # Output: [2, 11, 7, 15]
```

You can also test the second example in a similar way.
