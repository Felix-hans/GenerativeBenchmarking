To solve the given task, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort both `nums1` and `nums2` in ascending order. We will also create an array called `remaining` to keep track of the numbers in `nums2` that have not been assigned a larger number from `nums1`.
2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the current indices of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
3. Initialize an empty array called `result` to store the final permutation of `nums1`.
4. Iterate over each element `num` in `nums2`:
     - If the number at the `left` pointer in `nums1` is greater than `num`, assign it to the corresponding index in `result` and move the `left` pointer one step forward.
     - If the number at the `left` pointer in `nums1` is not greater than `num`, assign the smallest remaining number from `remaining` to the corresponding index in `result` and remove that number from `remaining`.
5. Return the `result` array.

Here's the implementation of the `advantageCount` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def advantageCount(self, nums1, nums2):
        nums1.sort()
        sorted_nums2 = sorted(nums2)
        remaining = []
        
        left = 0
        right = 0
        
        while left < len(nums1) and right < len(nums2):
            if nums1[left] > sorted_nums2[right]:
                nums1[left], sorted_nums2[right] = sorted_nums2[right], nums1[left]
                left += 1
                right += 1
            else:
                remaining.append(nums1[left])
                left += 1
        
        result = []
        
        for num in nums2:
            index = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_nums2, num)
            if index < len(sorted_nums2):
                result.append(sorted_nums2[index])
                sorted_nums2.pop(index)
            else:
                result.append(remaining.pop())
        
        return result
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `advantageCount` method with the given input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` to get the desired output.
