The given task is to find the number of boomerangs in a list of points in the plane. A boomerang is defined as a tuple of three points (i, j, k), where the distance between i and j is equal to the distance between i and k.

To solve this task, we can iterate over each point in the list and calculate the distance between that point and all other points. We can store the distances in a dictionary, where the key is the distance and the value is the number of points that have that distance from the current point.

Here's the implementation of the `numberOfBoomerangs` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        boomerangs = 0

        for i in range(len(points)):
            distances = {}
            for j in range(len(points)):
                if i != j:
                    distance = self.calculateDistance(points[i], points[j])
                    if distance in distances:
                        distances[distance] += 1
                    else:
                        distances[distance] = 1

            for distance_count in distances.values():
                boomerangs += distance_count * (distance_count - 1)

        return boomerangs

    def calculateDistance(self, point1, point2):
        x1, y1 = point1
        x2, y2 = point2
        return (x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2
```

We define a helper function `calculateDistance` to calculate the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula. The `numberOfBoomerangs` function iterates over each point, calculates the distances to all other points, and stores the distances in the `distances` dictionary. Then, we iterate over the values of the `distances` dictionary and count the number of boomerangs for each distance. Finally, we return the total number of boomerangs found.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numberOfBoomerangs` function with the input points to get the desired output.
