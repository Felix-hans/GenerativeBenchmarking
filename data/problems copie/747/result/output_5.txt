Here's the implementation of the `dominantIndex` function in Python to solve the given task:

```python
class Solution:
    def dominantIndex(self, nums):
        # Find the maximum element and its index
        max_val = max(nums)
        max_index = nums.index(max_val)
        
        # Check if the largest element is at least twice as much as every other number
        for num in nums:
            if num != max_val and max_val < 2 * num:
                return -1
        
        return max_index
```

You can use this solution by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `dominantIndex` method, passing the `nums` list as the argument. It will return the index of the largest element if it is at least twice as much as every other number, or -1 otherwise.

Example usage:
```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
result = solution.dominantIndex(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = solution.dominantIndex(nums)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```

Note: The code assumes that the input `nums` is a valid list of integers, and the largest element is unique.
