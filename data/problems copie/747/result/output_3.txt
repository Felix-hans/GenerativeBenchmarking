You can implement the given task in Python using the provided code snippet:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def dominantIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        largest = max(nums)
        index = nums.index(largest)
        
        for num in nums:
            if num != largest and num * 2 > largest:
                return -1
        
        return index
```

Here's how the code works:

1. We define a class `Solution` with a method `dominantIndex` that takes in an integer array `nums` and returns an integer.
2. We find the largest element in the array using the `max` function and store it in the variable `largest`.
3. We find the index of the largest element using the `index` method of the list.
4. We iterate through each element `num` in the array.
5. If `num` is not equal to the largest element and `num * 2` is greater than the largest element, we return -1, as the condition is not satisfied.
6. If the loop completes without returning -1, it means the largest element is at least twice as much as every other number. In this case, we return the index of the largest element.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `dominantIndex` method to test the implementation:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
print(solution.dominantIndex(nums))  # Output: 1

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(solution.dominantIndex(nums))  # Output: -1
```

This will give you the expected output for the given examples.
