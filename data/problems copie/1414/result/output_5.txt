To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by generating Fibonacci numbers until we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to k. Then, we subtract that Fibonacci number from k and repeat the process until k becomes zero. The count of Fibonacci numbers used will be the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers required to sum up to k.

Here's the implementation of the `findMinFibonacciNumbers` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinFibonacciNumbers(self, k: int) -> int:
        fib_nums = [1, 1]  # Initialize the list of Fibonacci numbers with F1 = 1 and F2 = 1
        while fib_nums[-1] < k:
            # Generate Fibonacci numbers until the largest Fibonacci number is less than or equal to k
            next_fib = fib_nums[-1] + fib_nums[-2]
            fib_nums.append(next_fib)

        count = 0
        i = len(fib_nums) - 1  # Start from the largest Fibonacci number
        while k > 0:
            if fib_nums[i] <= k:
                # If the current Fibonacci number is less than or equal to k, subtract it from k
                k -= fib_nums[i]
                count += 1
            else:
                i -= 1  # Move to the next smaller Fibonacci number

        return count
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `findMinFibonacciNumbers` method with the desired value of `k`. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
k = 7
result = solution.findMinFibonacciNumbers(k)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

The above code will print the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers required to sum up to `k`.
