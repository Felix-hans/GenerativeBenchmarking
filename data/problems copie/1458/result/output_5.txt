To solve the task, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum dot product between subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length.

Here's the implementation of the `maxDotProduct` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDotProduct(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                dp[i][j] = max(
                    nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1],  # Include current elements
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1],  # Extend previous subsequences
                    dp[i - 1][j],  # Exclude current element from nums2
                    dp[i][j - 1]  # Exclude current element from nums1
                )
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1])  # Check if previous subsequence is the maximum

        return dp[m][n]
```

The function `maxDotProduct` takes `nums1` and `nums2` as input and returns the maximum dot product between subsequences.

We initialize a 2D dynamic programming array `dp` with dimensions `(m+1) Ã— (n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. The extra row and column are used for handling the case of empty subsequences.

We then iterate over `i` and `j` from 1 to `m` and `n` respectively. For each combination of `i` and `j`, we calculate the maximum dot product by considering four possibilities:

1. Include the current elements from both arrays: `nums1[i-1] * nums2[j-1]`
2. Extend the previous subsequences by including the current elements: `dp[i-1][j-1] + nums1[i-1] * nums2[j-1]`
3. Exclude the current element from `nums2` and consider the previous subsequence from `nums1`: `dp[i-1][j]`
4. Exclude the current element from `nums1` and consider the previous subsequence from `nums2`: `dp[i][j-1]`

We update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum value among these possibilities. Additionally, we compare `dp[i][j]` with `dp[i-1][j-1]` to check if the previous subsequence is the maximum dot product without extending it.

Finally, we return `dp[m][n]`, which represents the maximum dot product between subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2` with the same length.

Please note that you need to import the `List` class from the `typing` module to use it as a type hint for the function arguments.
