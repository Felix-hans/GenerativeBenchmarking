To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum dot product for subarrays of `nums1` and `nums2`.

Here's the implementation of the `maxDotProduct` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDotProduct(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        
        # Initialize a 2D memoization table with -infinity values
        dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the memoization table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                # Calculate the dot product for the current subarrays
                curr_dot_product = nums1[i - 1] * nums2[j - 1]
                
                # Choose between including or excluding the current elements
                dp[i][j] = max(curr_dot_product, dp[i - 1][j - 1] + curr_dot_product, dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])
        
        return dp[m][n]
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the memoization table.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxDotProduct` method with your input arrays to obtain the result.
