To implement the given task in Python, you can create a solution using the `relativeSortArray` function inside the `Solution` class. Here's an example implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Create a dictionary to store the index of each element in arr2
        index_map = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(arr2)}
        
        # Sort arr1 based on the index of each element in arr2
        arr1.sort(key=lambda x: index_map.get(x, len(arr2) + x))
        
        return arr1
```

Explanation:
1. Create a dictionary called `index_map` to store the index of each element in `arr2`. The key is the element itself, and the value is its corresponding index in `arr2`.
2. Sort `arr1` using the `sort` method and a custom sorting key. The sorting key uses a lambda function that returns the index of each element in `arr2` from `index_map`. If an element is not present in `arr2`, it returns a value greater than any index in `arr2` (i.e., `len(arr2) + x` where `x` is the element).
3. Return the sorted `arr1`.

You can then create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `relativeSortArray` method with the input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. Here's an example usage:

```python
arr1 = [2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 2, 19]
arr2 = [2, 1, 4, 3, 9, 6]

solution = Solution()
result = solution.relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 9, 6, 7, 19]
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of `arr1`.
