To solve the problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible subsequences of the given array `arr`. For each subsequence, we check if it has unique characters and update the maximum length accordingly.

Here's the implementation of the `Solution` class with the `maxLength` method:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        def backtrack(start, path):
            nonlocal max_length
            if len(set(path)) != len(path):
                return
            max_length = max(max_length, len(path))
            for i in range(start, len(arr)):
                backtrack(i + 1, path + arr[i])

        max_length = 0
        backtrack(0, "")
        return max_length
```

In the `backtrack` function, `start` represents the index to start iterating from, and `path` is the current subsequence being formed. We check if the `path` has unique characters by comparing the length of its set with its original length. If they are different, it means there are duplicate characters in the subsequence, and we return without further exploration.

If the `path` has unique characters, we update the `max_length` variable if the length of `path` is greater than the current maximum length. Then, we iterate over the remaining elements in `arr` and recursively call `backtrack` with the updated `path` and the next index as the starting point.

Finally, we initialize `max_length` to 0 and start the backtracking process by calling `backtrack(0, "")`. The resulting `max_length` is returned as the maximum possible length of the concatenation with unique characters.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxLength` method with the input array to test it:

```python
solution = Solution()
arr = ["un", "iq", "ue"]
print(solution.maxLength(arr))  # Output: 4

arr = ["cha", "r", "act", "ers"]
print(solution.maxLength(arr))  # Output: 6

arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
print(solution.maxLength(arr))  # Output: 26
```

This will give you the expected output for the given examples.
