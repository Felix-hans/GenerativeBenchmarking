Here's an implementation of the `maxLength` function in Python to solve the given task:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        def backtrack(arr, index, curr):
            if len(set(curr)) != len(curr):
                return 0
            
            max_length = len(curr)
            
            for i in range(index, len(arr)):
                max_length = max(max_length, backtrack(arr, i + 1, curr + arr[i]))
            
            return max_length
        
        return backtrack(arr, 0, "")
```

Explanation:
1. The `maxLength` function takes in the `arr` list of strings as input and returns the maximum possible length of the concatenated string `s`.
2. Inside the `maxLength` function, we define a helper function called `backtrack` to perform backtracking to find the maximum length of the concatenated string.
3. In the `backtrack` function, we have three parameters: `arr` (the input list of strings), `index` (the current index we are considering in the `arr` list), and `curr` (the current concatenated string).
4. If the current concatenated string `curr` has duplicate characters, it means it is not a valid concatenation, so we return 0.
5. Otherwise, we update the `max_length` to be the maximum value between the current `max_length` and the length of the current concatenated string `curr`.
6. Then, we iterate over the remaining strings in `arr` starting from the `index + 1` and recursively call the `backtrack` function to explore all possible concatenations.
7. Finally, we return the `max_length` as the result of the `maxLength` function.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxLength` method with the input array to get the maximum possible length of the concatenated string.
