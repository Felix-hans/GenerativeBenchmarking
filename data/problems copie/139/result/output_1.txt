To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll create a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each element `dp[i]` will represent whether the substring from index 0 to i-1 can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

Initially, all elements of `dp` will be set to `False`. The base case is `dp[0] = True` since an empty string can always be segmented.

Then, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, we'll iterate through all previous indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`. If `dp[j]` is `True` (meaning the substring from 0 to j-1 can be segmented) and the substring from j to i-1 is present in the word dictionary, we'll set `dp[i] = True`.

Finally, we'll return `dp[n]`, which represents whether the entire string `s` can be segmented.

Here's the implementation of the `wordBreak` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = True

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in wordDict:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break

        return dp[n]
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `wordBreak` method to test it with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

s = "leetcode"
wordDict = ["leet","code"]
print(solution.wordBreak(s, wordDict))  # Output: True

s = "applepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
print(solution.wordBreak(s, wordDict))  # Output: True

s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
print(solution.wordBreak(s, wordDict))  # Output: False
```

The output will match the expected results for each example.
