Here's the implementation of the `isRobotBounded` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Define the initial position and direction
        x, y = 0, 0
        dx, dy = 0, 1  # Initial direction: North

        # Execute the instructions
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif instruction == 'L':
                dx, dy = -dy, dx  # Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise
            elif instruction == 'R':
                dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise

        # Check if the robot returns to the initial position or is facing a different direction
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or (dx != 0 or dy != 1)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isRobotBounded` function with the instructions as the argument. The function will return `True` if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle, and `False` otherwise.
