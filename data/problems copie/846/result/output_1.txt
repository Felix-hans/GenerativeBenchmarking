To solve this problem, we can follow the following steps:

1. Create a dictionary `card_count` to count the frequency of each card in the hand.
2. Sort the hand in ascending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted hand.
   - If the current card is already used (i.e., `card_count[card] == 0`), continue to the next card.
   - Otherwise, decrement the count of the current card in `card_count`.
   - Iterate from 1 to `groupSize - 1` (since we already have 1 card), and for each iteration:
     - Check if the next consecutive card exists in `card_count` and its count is greater than 0.
     - If it does, decrement the count of the consecutive card in `card_count`.
     - If it doesn't, return `False` as we cannot form a group.
4. If we successfully form all groups, return `True`.

Here's the implementation of the `isNStraightHand` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        card_count = {}
        for card in hand:
            card_count[card] = card_count.get(card, 0) + 1

        hand.sort()

        for card in hand:
            if card_count[card] == 0:
                continue
            
            card_count[card] -= 1
            
            for i in range(1, groupSize):
                next_card = card + i
                if card_count.get(next_card, 0) > 0:
                    card_count[next_card] -= 1
                else:
                    return False

        return True
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isNStraightHand` function with the given input to get the result. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
hand = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
groupSize = 3
result = solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
