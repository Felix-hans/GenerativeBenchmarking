Here's the implementation of the `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` function in Python:

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(self, points):
        total_time = 0
        
        for i in range(len(points) - 1):
            x1, y1 = points[i]
            x2, y2 = points[i + 1]
            
            # Calculate the horizontal and vertical distances
            dx = abs(x2 - x1)
            dy = abs(y2 - y1)
            
            # Calculate the diagonal distance (sqrt(2) units)
            diagonal_distance = min(dx, dy)
            
            # Calculate the remaining horizontal or vertical distance
            remaining_distance = max(dx, dy) - diagonal_distance
            
            # Calculate the total time to move from one point to another
            time = diagonal_distance * math.sqrt(2) + remaining_distance
            
            # Add the time to the total time
            total_time += time
        
        return int(total_time)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minTimeToVisitAllPoints` method, passing the points as the input. It will return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the given order.

Here's an example usage:

```python
points = [[1, 1], [3, 4], [-1, 0]]
solution = Solution()
min_time = solution.minTimeToVisitAllPoints(points)
print(min_time)  # Output: 7
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
