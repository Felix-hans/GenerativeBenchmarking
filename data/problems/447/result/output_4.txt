Here's the implementation of the `numberOfBoomerangs` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(points)):
            distances = {}
            
            for j in range(len(points)):
                if i != j:
                    distance = self.calculateDistance(points[i], points[j])
                    if distance in distances:
                        distances[distance] += 1
                    else:
                        distances[distance] = 1
            
            for distance in distances.values():
                count += distance * (distance - 1)
        
        return count
    
    def calculateDistance(self, point1: List[int], point2: List[int]) -> int:
        x1, y1 = point1
        x2, y2 = point2
        return (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2
```

In this solution, we iterate over each point and calculate the distance between that point and all other points. We keep track of the count of distances in a dictionary `distances`, where the keys are the distances and the values are the counts. For each distance, we calculate the number of possible boomerangs using the formula `distance * (distance - 1)` and add it to the `count` variable.

The `calculateDistance` function calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two points using the formula `distance = (x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2`. Note that we don't need to calculate the square root because we only need to compare distances.

Finally, we return the `count` as the result.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numberOfBoomerangs` method with your input points to get the desired output.
