To determine if the robot stays within a circle, we need to consider two factors: the final position of the robot and its final direction.

The robot will stay within a circle if it returns to the origin (0, 0) or if it faces a direction other than north after executing the instructions.

We can use a variable `direction` to keep track of the robot's current direction. Initially, `direction` is set to 0, representing north. We can also use variables `x` and `y` to keep track of the robot's position. Initially, `x` and `y` are set to 0.

We will iterate through the instructions and update the robot's position and direction accordingly. Here's an implementation of the `isRobotBounded` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize variables
        direction = 0  # 0: north, 1: east, 2: south, 3: west
        x, y = 0, 0

        # Iterate through instructions
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == "G":
                if direction == 0:
                    y += 1
                elif direction == 1:
                    x += 1
                elif direction == 2:
                    y -= 1
                else:  # direction == 3
                    x -= 1
            elif instruction == "L":
                direction = (direction - 1) % 4
            elif instruction == "R":
                direction = (direction + 1) % 4

        # Check if the robot returns to the origin or faces a direction other than north
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or direction != 0
```

Now we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
instructions = "GGLLGG"
print(solution.isRobotBounded(instructions))  # Output: True

# Example 2
instructions = "GG"
print(solution.isRobotBounded(instructions))  # Output: False

# Example 3
instructions = "GL"
print(solution.isRobotBounded(instructions))  # Output: True
```

The code should produce the expected outputs for the given examples.
