Here's an implementation of the `isRobotBounded` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Initial position and direction
        x, y = 0, 0
        dx, dy = 0, 1  # North direction

        # Perform the instructions
        for i in instructions:
            if i == 'G':
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif i == 'L':
                dx, dy = -dy, dx  # Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise
            elif i == 'R':
                dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise

        # After one iteration, if the robot is back to the initial position
        # or if it's not facing north, it will form a circle
        return (x, y) == (0, 0) or (dx, dy) != (0, 1)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isRobotBounded` method with the `instructions` string to check if the robot will stay within a circle. The method returns `True` if the robot forms a circle, and `False` otherwise.

Example usage:
```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GGLLGG"))  # True
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GG"))  # False
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GL"))  # True
```

Note: The solution works by simulating the robot's movements on an infinite plane. The robot will form a circle if it returns to the initial position and direction after one iteration of the instructions, or if it's not facing north.
