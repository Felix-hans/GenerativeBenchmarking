To solve the problem, we can simulate the movement of the robot and track its position and direction. If after executing all the instructions, the robot returns to the initial position or faces a direction other than north, it means the robot is bounded in a circle.

Here's the implementation of the `isRobotBounded` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Initial position and direction
        x, y = 0, 0  # coordinates
        dx, dy = 0, 1  # direction (north)

        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                # Move one unit in the current direction
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif instruction == 'L':
                # Turn 90 degrees to the left
                dx, dy = -dy, dx
            elif instruction == 'R':
                # Turn 90 degrees to the right
                dx, dy = dy, -dx

        # Check if the robot is either at the initial position or not facing north
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or (dx != 0 or dy != 1)
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isRobotBounded` method, passing the instructions as an argument, to check if the robot is bounded or not. For example:

```python
instructions = "GGLLGG"
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isRobotBounded(instructions))  # Output: True
```

You can try different instructions and observe the output to verify the correctness of the solution.
