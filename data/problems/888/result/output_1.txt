To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Alice and Bob have, respectively.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of candies Alice has and the total number of candies Bob has. Let's call this difference "diff".
3. Iterate over the candies Alice has and for each candy, check if there exists a candy in Bob's collection such that swapping them would make the total number of candies equal for both.
   - To do this efficiently, we can use a set to store the candies Bob has. This will allow us to check if a specific candy exists in constant time.
   - The candy that Alice would exchange is the current candy being considered in the iteration, and the candy that Bob would exchange is the candy in Bob's collection that would make the total number of candies equal after the exchange.
4. Once we find a candy pair that satisfies the conditions, we return it as the answer.

Here's the implementation of the `fairCandySwap` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def fairCandySwap(self, aliceSizes: List[int], bobSizes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        alice_total = sum(aliceSizes)
        bob_total = sum(bobSizes)
        diff = alice_total - bob_total
        
        bob_set = set(bobSizes)
        
        for candy in aliceSizes:
            target = candy - diff // 2
            if target in bob_set:
                return [candy, target]
```

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

aliceSizes = [1, 1]
bobSizes = [2, 2]
print(solution.fairCandySwap(aliceSizes, bobSizes))  # Output: [1, 2]

aliceSizes = [1, 2]
bobSizes = [2, 3]
print(solution.fairCandySwap(aliceSizes, bobSizes))  # Output: [1, 2]

aliceSizes = [2]
bobSizes = [1, 3]
print(solution.fairCandySwap(aliceSizes, bobSizes))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

The function will return the expected outputs for the provided examples.
