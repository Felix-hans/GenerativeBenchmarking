To solve the task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Alice and Bob have, respectively.
2. Calculate the difference between the total number of candies Alice and Bob have. Let's call this difference "diff".
3. Iterate over the candies in Alice's array. For each candy, calculate the target candy value that Alice needs to exchange with Bob. The target value can be calculated as "(candy + diff // 2)".
4. Check if the target value exists in Bob's array. If it does, return the current candy from Alice's array and the target value.
5. If no answer is found in step 4, it means that there is no valid answer. In this case, we can return an empty list or raise an exception.

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def fairCandySwap(self, aliceSizes: List[int], bobSizes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        sum_alice = sum(aliceSizes)
        sum_bob = sum(bobSizes)
        diff = sum_bob - sum_alice

        set_bob = set(bobSizes)

        for candy in aliceSizes:
            target = candy + diff // 2
            if target in set_bob:
                return [candy, target]

        return []  # No valid answer found
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `fairCandySwap` method with the given inputs to obtain the result.

Example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
aliceSizes = [1, 1]
bobSizes = [2, 2]
result = solution.fairCandySwap(aliceSizes, bobSizes)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2]
```

Note: The solution assumes that there is at least one valid answer for the given inputs, as stated in the problem constraints.
