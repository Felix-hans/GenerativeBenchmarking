To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product at each cell of the grid. We will initialize two 2D arrays, `max_dp` and `min_dp`, both of size `m x n`, to store the maximum and minimum products.

The idea is to calculate the maximum and minimum product for each cell based on the products from the adjacent cells (up and left). We need to consider the sign of the numbers in the grid. If a number is positive, the maximum product can be obtained by multiplying it with the maximum product so far. If a number is negative, the maximum product can be obtained by multiplying it with the minimum product so far. We also need to update the minimum product in a similar way.

To handle the modulo operation, we can take the modulo of the product at each step to prevent the product from becoming too large.

Here's the implementation of the `maxProductPath` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProductPath(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        max_dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        min_dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        max_dp[0][0] = min_dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]

        # Initialize the first row
        for j in range(1, n):
            max_dp[0][j] = max(max_dp[0][j-1] * grid[0][j], min_dp[0][j-1] * grid[0][j])
            min_dp[0][j] = min(max_dp[0][j-1] * grid[0][j], min_dp[0][j-1] * grid[0][j])

        # Initialize the first column
        for i in range(1, m):
            max_dp[i][0] = max(max_dp[i-1][0] * grid[i][0], min_dp[i-1][0] * grid[i][0])
            min_dp[i][0] = min(max_dp[i-1][0] * grid[i][0], min_dp[i-1][0] * grid[i][0])

        # Fill in the rest of the grid
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if grid[i][j] >= 0:
                    max_dp[i][j] = max(max_dp[i-1][j], max_dp[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j]
                    min_dp[i][j] = min(min_dp[i-1][j], min_dp[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j]
                else:
                    max_dp[i][j] = min(min_dp[i-1][j], min_dp[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j]
                    min_dp[i][j] = max(max_dp[i-1][j], max_dp[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j]

        max_product = max_dp[m-1][n-1]

        return max_product % MOD if max_product >= 0 else -1
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxProductPath` function with the input grid to get the maximum non-negative product modulo 10^9 + 7.
