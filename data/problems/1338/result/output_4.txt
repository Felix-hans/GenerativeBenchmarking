To solve the task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Sort the numbers based on their frequency in descending order.
3. Iterate over the sorted frequencies until we remove enough numbers to reach half of the array's size.
4. Return the number of iterations as the minimum size of the set.

Here's the implementation of the `minSetSize` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minSetSize(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each number
        frequency = Counter(arr)

        # Step 2: Sort the numbers based on frequency in descending order
        sorted_freq = sorted(frequency.values(), reverse=True)

        # Step 3: Remove numbers until reaching half of the array's size
        target_size = len(arr) // 2
        set_size = 0
        removed_count = 0
        for freq in sorted_freq:
            removed_count += freq
            set_size += 1
            if removed_count >= target_size:
                break

        # Step 4: Return the minimum size of the set
        return set_size
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minSetSize` method with the array as the argument. It will return the minimum size of the set needed to remove at least half of the integers in the array.
