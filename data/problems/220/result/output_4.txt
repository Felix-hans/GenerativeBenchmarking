To solve this task, we can iterate through the array `nums` and for each element, check if there exists another element within the specified index and value differences.

Here's the implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], indexDiff: int, valueDiff: int) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        num_set = set()  # Set to store the unique values within the specified index difference
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Remove the element that is outside the index difference window
            if i > indexDiff:
                num_set.remove(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])
            
            # Check if there exists a value within the specified value difference
            for num in num_set:
                if abs(num - nums[i]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
            
            # Add the current element to the set
            num_set.add(nums[i])
        
        return False
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` method with the given inputs to check if a pair satisfying the conditions exists:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
indexDiff = 3
valueDiff = 0

solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

```python
nums = [1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9]
indexDiff = 2
valueDiff = 3

solution = Solution()
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

The implementation uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the unique values within the index difference window. We iterate through the array and add each element to the set. If there exists a value within the specified value difference, we return `True`. After iterating through the array, if no such pair is found, we return `False`.
