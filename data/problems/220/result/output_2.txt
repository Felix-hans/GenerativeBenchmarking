To solve the given task, we can iterate over the array `nums` and for each element, check if there exists another element within the specified index and value differences. We can use a nested loop to compare each pair of elements and check the conditions.

Here's the implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], indexDiff: int, valueDiff: int) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, min(i + indexDiff + 1, n)):
                if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
        
        return False
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * min(indexDiff, n)), where n is the length of the `nums` array.
