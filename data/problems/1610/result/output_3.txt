To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Calculate the angles between each point and the location, relative to the positive x-axis.
2. Create a list to store the angles.
3. Count the number of points at the location.
4. Iterate through each point and calculate its angle using the `atan2` function from the math module.
5. Adjust the angles to be between 0 and 360 degrees.
6. Sort the angles in ascending order.
7. Duplicate the sorted angles list to handle circular cases.
8. Iterate through the duplicated angles list using a sliding window of size `points.length`.
9. Calculate the difference between the angles within the window and check if it falls within the given angle range.
10. Update the maximum number of visible points.
11. Return the maximum number of visible points.

Here's the implementation of the `visiblePoints` function:

```python
from math import atan2, degrees
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def visiblePoints(self, points: List[List[int]], angle: int, location: List[int]) -> int:
        angles = []
        num_points_at_location = 0
        max_visible_points = 0

        for point in points:
            if point == location:
                num_points_at_location += 1
            else:
                x, y = point[0] - location[0], point[1] - location[1]
                angle = degrees(atan2(y, x))
                angles.append(angle)

        angles.sort()
        angles += [angle + 360 for angle in angles]  # Duplicate angles for circular cases

        left = 0
        for right in range(len(angles)):
            while angles[right] - angles[left] > angle:
                left += 1
            max_visible_points = max(max_visible_points, right - left + 1)

        return max_visible_points + num_points_at_location
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `visiblePoints` function with the given input to test it out:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
points1 = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]
angle1 = 90
location1 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points1, angle1, location1))  # Output: 3

# Example 2
points2 = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [1, 1]]
angle2 = 90
location2 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points2, angle2, location2))  # Output: 4

# Example 3
points3 = [[1, 0], [2, 1]]
angle3 = 13
location3 = [1, 1]
print(solution.visiblePoints(points3, angle3, location3))  # Output: 1
```

The code will output the maximum number of visible points for each example.
