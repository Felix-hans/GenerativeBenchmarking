To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Initialize the variables `max_quality` to 0 and `(cx, cy)` to (-1, -1). These variables will store the maximum network quality and the corresponding coordinate.

2. Iterate over each coordinate `(x, y)` in the range of `(0, 51)` for both `x` and `y`. This will cover all possible coordinates within the constraints.

3. For each coordinate `(x, y)`, calculate the network quality as follows:

   a. Initialize `total_quality` to 0, which will store the network quality at the current coordinate.
   
   b. Iterate over each tower in the given `towers` array.
   
   c. Calculate the distance `d` between the current tower and the coordinate `(x, y)` using the Euclidean distance formula: `d = sqrt((x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2)`.
   
   d. If the distance `d` is less than or equal to the given `radius`, calculate the signal quality `signal` for the tower using the formula: `signal = floor(qi / (1 + d))`, where `qi` is the tower's quality factor.
   
   e. Add the `signal` to the `total_quality`.
   
   f. Update `max_quality` and `(cx, cy)` if the `total_quality` is greater than `max_quality` or if it is equal to `max_quality` but `(x, y)` is lexicographically smaller than `(cx, cy)`.
   
4. Return the coordinate `(cx, cy)` as the result.

Here's the implementation of the `bestCoordinate` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List
import math

class Solution:
    def bestCoordinate(self, towers: List[List[int]], radius: int) -> List[int]:
        max_quality = 0
        cx, cy = -1, -1

        for x in range(51):
            for y in range(51):
                total_quality = 0

                for tower in towers:
                    xi, yi, qi = tower
                    d = math.sqrt((x - xi) ** 2 + (y - yi) ** 2)

                    if d <= radius:
                        signal = math.floor(qi / (1 + d))
                        total_quality += signal

                if total_quality > max_quality or (total_quality == max_quality and (x, y) < (cx, cy)):
                    max_quality = total_quality
                    cx, cy = x, y

        return [cx, cy]
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `bestCoordinate` function with the given inputs to get the desired result.
