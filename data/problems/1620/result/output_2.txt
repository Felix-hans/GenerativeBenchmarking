To solve the problem, we can iterate over each coordinate in the given range and calculate the network quality at each coordinate. We will keep track of the maximum network quality and the lexicographically minimum coordinate with the maximum quality.

Here's the implementation of the `bestCoordinate` function:

```python
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def bestCoordinate(self, towers: List[List[int]], radius: int) -> List[int]:
        max_quality = 0
        best_coordinate = [float('inf'), float('inf')]  # Initialize with a large coordinate
        
        for x in range(51):
            for y in range(51):
                quality = 0
                
                for tower in towers:
                    xi, yi, qi = tower
                    distance = math.sqrt((xi - x) ** 2 + (yi - y) ** 2)
                    
                    if distance <= radius:
                        quality += qi // (1 + distance)
                
                if quality > max_quality:
                    max_quality = quality
                    best_coordinate = [x, y]
                elif quality == max_quality:
                    best_coordinate = min(best_coordinate, [x, y])  # Update lexicographically minimum coordinate
        
        return best_coordinate
```

This solution iterates over each coordinate (x, y) in the range [0, 50]. For each coordinate, it calculates the distance from each tower and checks if it is within the given radius. If a tower is reachable, it calculates the signal quality and adds it to the overall quality at that coordinate.

The function keeps track of the maximum quality and the lexicographically minimum coordinate with the maximum quality. If a new coordinate has a higher quality, it becomes the new best coordinate. If the quality is the same, the function updates the best coordinate to be the lexicographically minimum one.

Finally, the function returns the best coordinate with the maximum network quality.
