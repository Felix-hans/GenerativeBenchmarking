To solve this task, we can use dynamic programming to build the solution iteratively. We'll define two arrays, `dp_A` and `dp_P`, to store the number of valid records ending with 'A' and 'P' respectively.

For each day, we'll update the arrays based on the following rules:
1. To update `dp_P[i]`, we can append 'P' to any valid record ending with 'A', 'P', or 'L'.
2. To update `dp_A[i]`, we can append 'A' to any valid record ending with 'P' or 'L', as long as the total number of absences so far is less than 2.

Finally, the total number of valid records of length `n` will be the sum of `dp_A[n-1]`, `dp_P[n-1]`, and `dp_L[n-1]`.

Here's the implementation of the `checkRecord` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Initialize arrays for dynamic programming
        dp_A = [0] * n
        dp_P = [0] * n

        # Base cases
        dp_A[0] = 1
        dp_P[0] = 1

        if n > 1:
            dp_L = [0] * n
            dp_L[1] = 1

        # Update arrays iteratively
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp_P[i] = (dp_A[i - 1] + dp_P[i - 1] + (dp_L[i - 1] if i > 1 else 0)) % MOD
            dp_A[i] = (dp_P[i - 1] + (dp_P[i - 2] if i > 1 else 0)) % MOD
            if i > 1:
                dp_L[i] = (dp_A[i - 1] + dp_A[i - 2]) % MOD

        # Calculate the total number of valid records
        total = (dp_A[n - 1] + dp_P[n - 1] + (dp_L[n - 1] if n > 1 else 0)) % MOD

        return total
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `checkRecord` method to get the result:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 2
result = solution.checkRecord(n)
print(result)
```

The output will be:
```
8
```

You can also try other values of `n` to test the solution.
