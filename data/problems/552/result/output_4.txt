To solve this task, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the number of eligible attendance records of length `n`.

We can define two arrays `dpA` and `dpP`, where `dpA[i]` represents the number of eligible records of length `i` that end with an 'A', and `dpP[i]` represents the number of eligible records of length `i` that do not end with an 'A'. We will also define two additional arrays `dpL` and `dpPL`, where `dpL[i]` represents the number of eligible records of length `i` that end with an 'L', and `dpPL[i]` represents the number of eligible records of length `i` that end with a 'P' followed by an 'L'.

We can initialize the arrays as follows:
- `dpA[0] = 0` (no records of length 0 can end with an 'A')
- `dpP[0] = 1` (one record of length 0 can end with a 'P')
- `dpL[0] = 0` (no records of length 0 can end with an 'L')
- `dpPL[0] = 0` (no records of length 0 can end with a 'P' followed by an 'L')

Then, we can use a loop to calculate the values for `dpA`, `dpP`, `dpL`, and `dpPL` iteratively for lengths 1 to `n`. At each step, we can update the values based on the following rules:

- `dpA[i] = dpP[i-1] + dpL[i-1] + dpPL[i-1]` (an 'A' can only follow a record that does not end with an 'A')
- `dpP[i] = dpA[i-1] + dpP[i-1] + dpL[i-1] + dpPL[i-1]` (a 'P' can follow any type of record)
- `dpL[i] = dpP[i-1]` (an 'L' can only follow a record that does not end with an 'L')
- `dpPL[i] = dpL[i-1]` (a 'P' followed by an 'L' can only follow a record that ends with a 'P')

Finally, the total number of eligible records of length `n` is given by the sum of `dpA[n]`, `dpP[n]`, `dpL[n]`, and `dpPL[n]`.

Here's the implementation of the `checkRecord` method in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, n: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        dpA = [0] * (n + 1)
        dpP = [0] * (n + 1)
        dpL = [0] * (n + 1)
        dpPL = [0] * (n + 1)

        dpP[0] = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dpA[i] = (dpP[i - 1] + dpL[i - 1] + dpPL[i - 1]) % mod
            dpP[i] = (dpA[i - 1] + dpP[i - 1] + dpL[i - 1] + dpPL[i - 1]) % mod
            dpL[i] = dpP[i - 1] % mod
            dpPL[i] = dpL[i - 1] % mod
