To solve the problem, we can use a dictionary to count the number of rabbits with each answer. Then, for each unique answer, we can calculate the minimum number of rabbits based on the answer and add it to the result.

Here's the implementation of the `numRabbits` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numRabbits(self, answers: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        result = 0
        
        # Count the number of rabbits with each answer
        for answer in answers:
            if answer not in count:
                count[answer] = 1
            else:
                count[answer] += 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of rabbits based on the answer
        for answer, rabbits in count.items():
            # If there are x rabbits with the same answer,
            # we need (x // (answer + 1)) groups of (answer + 1) rabbits,
            # and any remaining rabbits will form another group.
            result += (answer + 1) * ((rabbits + answer) // (answer + 1))
        
        return result
```

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numRabbits` function with the input array to get the minimum number of rabbits. Here's an example:

```python
solution = Solution()
answers = [1, 1, 2]
min_rabbits = solution.numRabbits(answers)
print(min_rabbits)  # Output: 5
```

The code will output the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest based on the given answers.
