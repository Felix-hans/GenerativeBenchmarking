To solve this task, we can utilize the concept of dynamic programming. We'll iterate from 0 to n and use the previously calculated counts to determine the count of 1's in the binary representation of each number.

Here's the implementation of the `countBits` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize the result array with 0's
        ans = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # To count the number of 1's in i,
            # we shift i to the right by 1 bit and
            # add the least significant bit (i & 1) to the count
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)

        return ans
```

This implementation has a runtime of O(n) and solves the task in a single pass.

Note: The `List` type used in the function signature is assumed to be `List[int]` from the `typing` module.
