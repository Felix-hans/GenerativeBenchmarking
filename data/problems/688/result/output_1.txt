To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the probability of the knight staying on the board after each move. We can create a 3-dimensional grid of size (n x n x (k+1)) to store the probabilities.

Here's the Python implementation for the `knightProbability` method:

```python
class Solution:
    def knightProbability(self, n: int, k: int, row: int, column: int) -> float:
        # Define the possible moves of a knight
        moves = [(2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)]
        
        # Initialize a 3-dimensional grid to store the probabilities
        dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(k + 1)]
        
        # Set the initial probability for the starting position
        dp[0][row][column] = 1
        
        # Iterate for each move
        for m in range(1, k + 1):
            for r in range(n):
                for c in range(n):
                    # Calculate the probability for the current position
                    for move in moves:
                        prev_r, prev_c = r - move[0], c - move[1]
                        if 0 <= prev_r < n and 0 <= prev_c < n:
                            dp[m][r][c] += dp[m-1][prev_r][prev_c] / 8.0
        
        # Calculate the total probability of staying on the board
        probability = sum(sum(row) for row in dp[k])
        return probability
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `knightProbability` method to solve the problem. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
result = solution.knightProbability(3, 2, 0, 0)
print(result)  # Output: 0.0625
```

Similarly, you can test other inputs by calling the `knightProbability` method with appropriate arguments.
