To solve the problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card value in the hand. Then, we can iterate through the hand and for each card, check if it can be the start of a group by verifying if there are enough remaining cards of consecutive values to form a group of size `groupSize`. If a group can be formed, we reduce the counts of the cards in the group from the dictionary. If at any point we encounter a card that cannot be the start of a group, or the dictionary becomes empty before forming all the required groups, we return False. Otherwise, we return True.

Here's the implementation of the `isNStraightHand` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        # Count the occurrences of each card
        card_counts = {}
        for card in hand:
            card_counts[card] = card_counts.get(card, 0) + 1

        while card_counts:
            # Find the minimum card value
            min_card = min(card_counts)

            # Check if we can form a group starting from the minimum card
            for i in range(min_card, min_card + groupSize):
                if i not in card_counts:
                    return False
                card_counts[i] -= 1
                if card_counts[i] == 0:
                    del card_counts[i]

        return True
```

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

hand = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
groupSize = 3
print(solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize))  # Output: True

hand = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
groupSize = 4
print(solution.isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize))  # Output: False
```

The function should return the expected results for the given examples.
