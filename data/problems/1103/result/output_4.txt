Here's the implementation of the `distributeCandies` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, candies: int, num_people: int) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0] * num_people  # Initialize the distribution array
        curr_candies = 1  # Number of candies to be distributed
        
        # Iterate until we run out of candies
        while candies > 0:
            for i in range(num_people):
                # If there are no more candies, exit the loop
                if candies <= 0:
                    break
                # Distribute candies to the current person
                ans[i] += min(curr_candies, candies)
                candies -= curr_candies
                curr_candies += 1

        return ans
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `distributeCandies` method with the given inputs to get the final distribution of candies. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
candies = 7
num_people = 4
result = solution.distributeCandies(candies, num_people)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1]
```

```python
solution = Solution()
candies = 10
num_people = 3
result = solution.distributeCandies(candies, num_people)
print(result)  # Output: [5, 2, 3]
```

The `distributeCandies` function follows the described distribution process and keeps track of the remaining candies using a `candies` variable. It distributes the candies in a round-robin manner, incrementing the number of candies given in each round. The loop breaks when there are no more candies to distribute. The final distribution is returned as a list.
