To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with a priority queue (min heap) to efficiently select the engineers with the highest efficiency.

Here's the implementation of the `maxPerformance` function:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, speed: List[int], efficiency: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        engineers = list(zip(efficiency, speed))  # Combine efficiency and speed into tuples
        engineers.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort engineers in descending order of efficiency

        max_performance = 0
        total_speed = 0
        heap = []
        for eff, spd in engineers:
            heapq.heappush(heap, spd)  # Add speed to the heap
            total_speed += spd

            if len(heap) > k:
                total_speed -= heapq.heappop(heap)  # Remove the engineer with the lowest speed

            max_performance = max(max_performance, total_speed * eff)

        return max_performance % (10**9 + 7)
```

The function takes in the number of engineers `n`, the speed list `speed`, the efficiency list `efficiency`, and the maximum number of engineers `k` to select. It returns the maximum performance modulo 10^9 + 7.

In the function, we combine the efficiency and speed of each engineer into tuples and sort them in descending order of efficiency. This allows us to prioritize engineers with higher efficiency.

We then iterate over the engineers and maintain a heap (min heap) with the `k` engineers with the highest speed. We also keep track of the total speed and update it as we add or remove engineers from the heap.

For each engineer, we calculate the current performance by multiplying the total speed with the engineer's efficiency. We update the maximum performance if the current performance is higher.

Finally, we return the maximum performance modulo 10^9 + 7 to satisfy the constraints of the problem.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxPerformance` function with the given inputs to get the desired result.
