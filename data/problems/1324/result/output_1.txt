You can implement the given task in Python by following these steps:

1. Split the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method, which splits the string based on whitespace.
2. Find the maximum length among all the words in the list obtained from step 1. This will determine the number of columns in the vertical representation.
3. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the vertically printed words.
4. Iterate `i` from 0 to the maximum word length - 1. This will represent the current column.
5. For each column `i`, iterate through the words in the list obtained from step 1.
   - If the word has a length greater than or equal to `i+1`, add the `i`-th character of the word to the corresponding column in the `result` list.
   - Otherwise, add a space character to the corresponding column in the `result` list.
6. Finally, return the `result` list as the output.

Here's the implementation of the `printVertically` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def printVertically(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        words = s.split()
        max_length = max(len(word) for word in words)
        result = []
        
        for i in range(max_length):
            column = []
            for word in words:
                if i < len(word):
                    column.append(word[i])
                else:
                    column.append(' ')
            result.append(''.join(column).rstrip())
        
        return result
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `printVertically` method with the input string to get the desired output. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "HOW ARE YOU"
output = solution.printVertically(s)
print(output)
```

Output:
```
['HAY', 'ORO', 'WEU']
```

You can repeat the same process for other test cases as well.
