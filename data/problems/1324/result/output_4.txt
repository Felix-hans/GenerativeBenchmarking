To solve this task, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method, which splits the string at whitespace.
2. Find the length of the longest word in the list of words. This will determine the number of columns in our vertical representation.
3. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the vertically arranged words.
4. Iterate over the range of the length of the longest word.
5. For each column index `i`, iterate over the words in the list of words.
6. If the word has a length greater than `i`, append the character at index `i` to the `result` list.
   - Otherwise, append a space to the `result` list.
7. Join the characters in each column of the `result` list to form strings.
8. Return the `result` list as the final output.

Here's the implementation of the `printVertically` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def printVertically(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        words = s.split()
        max_length = max(len(word) for word in words)
        result = []
        
        for i in range(max_length):
            column = ''
            for word in words:
                if i < len(word):
                    column += word[i]
                else:
                    column += ' '
            result.append(column.rstrip())  # Remove trailing spaces
        
        return result
```

Now we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test the function with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

s = "HOW ARE YOU"
print(solution.printVertically(s))
# Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]

s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
print(solution.printVertically(s))
# Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]

s = "CONTEST IS COMING"
print(solution.printVertically(s))
# Output: ["CIC","OSO","N M","T I","E N","S G","T"]
```

The code will produce the expected outputs for the given examples.
