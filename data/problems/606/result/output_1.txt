To construct a string consisting of parentheses and integers from a binary tree using the preorder traversal, we can recursively traverse the tree while building the string representation. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. If the root node is None, return an empty string.
2. If the root has no children (left and right), return the string representation of its value.
3. If the root has only a right child (and no left child), return the string representation of its value followed by an empty set of parentheses and the recursive call on its right child.
4. Otherwise, construct the string by concatenating the string representation of the root's value with an opening parenthesis.
5. Recursively call the function on the left child and append its result to the constructed string.
6. If the root has a right child, append an empty set of parentheses followed by the recursive call on the right child and close the parentheses.
7. Close the opening parenthesis of the root.
8. Return the constructed string.

Here's the implementation of the `tree2str` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def tree2str(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        if root is None:
            return ""

        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return str(root.val)

        if root.right is None:
            return str(root.val) + "(" + self.tree2str(root.left) + ")"

        return str(root.val) + "(" + self.tree2str(root.left) + ")(" + self.tree2str(root.right) + ")"
```

You can now use this solution to convert a binary tree into a string representation using the preorder traversal.
