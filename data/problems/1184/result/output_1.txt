To solve this task, we can follow the following steps:

1. Calculate the total distance of the circular route by summing up all the distances in the `distance` list.
2. Calculate the clockwise distance from the `start` stop to the `destination` stop by iterating from `start` to `destination` and summing up the distances in between. If `start` is greater than `destination`, we need to wrap around to the beginning of the `distance` list.
3. Calculate the counterclockwise distance from the `start` stop to the `destination` stop by iterating from `start` to `destination` and summing up the distances in between. If `start` is smaller than `destination`, we need to wrap around to the end of the `distance` list.
4. Return the minimum of the clockwise distance and the counterclockwise distance.

Here's the implementation of the `distanceBetweenBusStops` method:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def distanceBetweenBusStops(self, distance: List[int], start: int, destination: int) -> int:
        n = len(distance)
        total_distance = sum(distance)
        clockwise_distance = 0
        counterclockwise_distance = 0

        # Calculate clockwise distance
        if start <= destination:
            clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:destination])
        else:
            clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:]) + sum(distance[:destination])

        # Calculate counterclockwise distance
        if start >= destination:
            counterclockwise_distance = sum(distance[destination:start])
        else:
            counterclockwise_distance = sum(distance[destination:]) + sum(distance[:start])

        return min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `distanceBetweenBusStops` method with the appropriate arguments to test it out. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
distance = [1, 2, 3, 4]
start = 0
destination = 1
result = solution.distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```
