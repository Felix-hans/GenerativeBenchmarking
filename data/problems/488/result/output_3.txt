To solve the problem, we can use a recursive approach. Here's the implementation of the `findMinStep` function:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findMinStep(self, board: str, hand: str) -> int:
        # Helper function to remove consecutive groups of balls from the board
        def removeGroups(board):
            i, n = 0, len(board)
            while i < n:
                j = i
                while j < n and board[j] == board[i]:
                    j += 1
                if j - i >= 3:
                    # Remove the group of balls from the board
                    board = board[:i] + board[j:]
                    n = len(board)
                    i = max(0, i - 2)
                else:
                    i = j
            return board
        
        # Recursive function to find the minimum number of balls to clear the board
        def dfs(board, hand):
            if not board:
                return 0  # Board is already empty
            
            if not hand:
                return -1  # No more balls to insert
            
            minBalls = float('inf')  # Initialize with a large value
            
            for i in range(len(hand)):
                for j in range(len(board) + 1):
                    # Insert ball from hand into the board
                    newBoard = board[:j] + hand[i] + board[j:]
                    
                    # Remove consecutive groups of balls from the board
                    newBoard = removeGroups(newBoard)
                    
                    # Recursively find the minimum number of balls to clear the remaining board
                    res = dfs(newBoard, hand[:i] + hand[i+1:])
                    
                    if res != -1:
                        # Update the minimum number of balls required
                        minBalls = min(minBalls, 1 + res)
            
            return minBalls if minBalls != float('inf') else -1

        # Count the number of balls in the hand
        handCount = Counter(hand)
        
        # Call the recursive function
        minBalls = dfs(board, handCount)
        
        return minBalls if minBalls != float('inf') else -1
```

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
board = "WRRBBW"
hand = "RB"
print(solution.findMinStep(board, hand))  # Output: -1

# Example 2
board = "WWRRBBWW"
hand = "WRBRW"
print(solution.findMinStep(board, hand))  # Output: 2

# Example 3
board = "G"
hand = "GGGGG"
print(solution.findMinStep(board, hand))  # Output: 2
```

The code will output the expected results for the given examples.
