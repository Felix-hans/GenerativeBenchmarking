To solve this task, we can use a backtracking algorithm. Here's the implementation of the `findMinStep` method in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findMinStep(self, board: str, hand: str) -> int:
        self.min_balls = float('inf')
        hand_count = Counter(hand)
        self.backtrack(board, hand_count)
        return self.min_balls if self.min_balls < float('inf') else -1

    def backtrack(self, board, hand_count, balls_used=0):
        if not board:
            self.min_balls = min(self.min_balls, balls_used)
            return

        if not hand_count:
            return

        i = 0
        while i < len(board):
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(board) and board[i] == board[j]:
                j += 1

            needed_balls = 3 - (j - i)
            if hand_count[board[i]] >= needed_balls:
                removed_balls = board[i:j]
                new_board = self.remove_balls(board[:i] + board[j:])
                hand_count[board[i]] -= needed_balls
                self.backtrack(new_board, hand_count, balls_used + needed_balls)
                hand_count[board[i]] += needed_balls

            i = j

    def remove_balls(self, board):
        i = 0
        while i < len(board):
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(board) and board[i] == board[j]:
                j += 1

            if j - i >= 3:
                return self.remove_balls(board[:i] + board[j:])

            i = j

        return board
```

We start by defining the `Solution` class and the `findMinStep` method that takes the `board` and `hand` strings as input and returns the minimum number of balls needed to clear the board.

Inside the `findMinStep` method, we initialize a variable `min_balls` to infinity. We also create a counter `hand_count` to keep track of the count of each ball in the hand.

We then call the `backtrack` method, passing the `board`, `hand_count`, and `balls_used` as arguments.

In the `backtrack` method, we have the following base cases:
- If the `board` is empty, we update `min_balls` with the minimum value between the current `min_balls` and `balls_used` and return.
- If the `hand_count` is empty (i.e., we have used all the balls in the hand), we return.

Next, we iterate through the `board` using two pointers, `i` and `j`, to identify groups of consecutive balls with the same color. We calculate the number of needed balls to form a group of three by subtracting the length of the group from 3.

If the count of the current ball in the hand (`hand_count[board[i]]`) is greater than or equal to the needed balls, we can remove the group from the board. We update the `hand_count` and recursively call the `backtrack` method with the updated `board`, `hand_count`, and `balls_used`.

After the recursive call, we restore the original `hand_count` by adding back the balls used in the current iteration.

Finally, we define the `remove_balls` method to remove groups of three or more consecutive balls from the board. We use a similar approach as in the `backtrack` method, iterating through the board and removing groups of consecutive balls until there are no more groups
