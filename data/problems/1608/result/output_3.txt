Here's the Python implementation of the `specialArray` function that solves the given task:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def specialArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort the array in descending order
        
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] < i + 1:
                return -1
            if i == n - 1 or nums[i + 1] < i + 1:
                return i + 1
        return -1
```

Explanation:

1. We start by sorting the `nums` array in descending order using the `sort` function.
2. We iterate through the sorted array and check if the current number is less than the index plus 1 (i.e., `nums[i] < i + 1`).
   - If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough numbers greater than or equal to the current index, so we return -1.
   - We also check if we have reached the last element in the array (`i == n - 1`) or if the next number is less than the current index plus 1 (`nums[i + 1] < i + 1`).
     - If either of these conditions is true, it means that the current index is the special number `x`, so we return `i + 1`.
3. If we haven't returned any value inside the loop, it means that there is no special number, so we return -1.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `specialArray` method on it to test the implementation.
