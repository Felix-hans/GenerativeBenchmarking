Here's an implementation of the `getMaxLen` function in Python that solves the given task:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def getMaxLen(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_len = 0
        negative_count = 0
        first_negative_index = -1
        zero_index = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < 0:
                negative_count += 1
                if first_negative_index == -1:
                    first_negative_index = i
            elif nums[i] == 0:
                negative_count = 0
                first_negative_index = -1
                zero_index = i
            if negative_count % 2 == 0:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - zero_index)
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - first_negative_index)
        
        return max_len
```

The function `getMaxLen` takes in an array `nums` as input and returns the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product.

The algorithm iterates through the array, keeping track of the number of negative numbers encountered (`negative_count`), the index of the first negative number (`first_negative_index`), and the index of the last encountered zero (`zero_index`).

If a negative number is encountered, `negative_count` is incremented, and if `first_negative_index` is not yet set, it is set to the current index. If a zero is encountered, `negative_count` and `first_negative_index` are reset, and `zero_index` is set to the current index.

At each iteration, the algorithm checks if the number of negative numbers encountered so far (`negative_count`) is even or odd. If it is even, the current subarray (from the last zero index to the current index) has a positive product, and its length is compared with the `max_len` to update it if necessary. If `negative_count` is odd, the current subarray (from the first negative index to the current index) has a positive product, and its length is compared with `max_len` to update it if necessary.

Finally, the function returns the `max_len`, which represents the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product.
