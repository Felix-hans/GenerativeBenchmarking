To find the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product, we can iterate through the array and keep track of two variables: `max_len` and `neg_count`.

The variable `max_len` will store the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product encountered so far, and `neg_count` will keep track of the number of negative elements encountered in the current subarray.

Here's the implementation of the `getMaxLen` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxLen(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_len = 0  # Maximum length of subarray with positive product
        neg_count = 0  # Number of negative elements in the current subarray
        first_neg = -1  # Index of the first negative element in the current subarray

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                neg_count = 0
                first_neg = -1
            elif nums[i] < 0:
                neg_count += 1
                if first_neg == -1:
                    first_neg = i
            if neg_count % 2 == 0:
                max_len = max(max_len, i + 1)
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - first_neg)

        return max_len
```

This implementation iterates through the `nums` array and updates the `max_len` and `neg_count` variables accordingly. When a zero is encountered, it resets `neg_count` and `first_neg`. When a negative number is encountered, it increments `neg_count` and updates `first_neg` if it is the first negative element in the current subarray.

Finally, the function returns the `max_len`, which represents the maximum length of a subarray with a positive product.
