To solve the given task, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of binary trees we can make.

Here's the implementation of the `numFactoredBinaryTrees` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, arr):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        arr.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [1] * n  # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1's

        # Create a dictionary to store the index of each number in the array
        index = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(arr)}

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                # Check if arr[i] is divisible by arr[j]
                if arr[i] % arr[j] == 0:
                    # Calculate the complement of arr[i] / arr[j]
                    complement = arr[i] // arr[j]
                    # If the complement exists in the array, update the dynamic programming array
                    if complement in index:
                        dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[index[complement]]
                        dp[i] %= MOD

        # Sum up all the counts in the dynamic programming array
        total_count = sum(dp) % MOD
        return total_count
```

The solution uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the count of binary trees we can make for each number in the array. The idea is to iterate over each number and its divisors to calculate the count.

By sorting the array in ascending order, we ensure that when we process a number `arr[i]`, all its divisors `arr[j]` (where `j < i`) have already been processed. This way, we can use the counts stored in `dp` for the divisors to calculate the count for `arr[i]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because, in the worst case, we iterate over each number and its divisors. Since n can be up to 1000, this solution is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.
