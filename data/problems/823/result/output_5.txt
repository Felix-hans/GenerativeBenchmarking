To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of binary trees we can make for each integer in the array. We'll store the count in a dictionary to avoid recomputing the values.

Here's the implementation of the `numFactoredBinaryTrees` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, arr):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        arr.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        dp = {}  # Dictionary to store the count of binary trees for each integer

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            dp[arr[i]] = 1  # Initialize the count to 1 for each individual integer
            for j in range(i):
                if arr[i] % arr[j] == 0:
                    # If arr[j] is a factor of arr[i]
                    factor = arr[i] // arr[j]
                    if factor in dp:
                        # If the factor exists in the dictionary, update the count
                        dp[arr[i]] += dp[arr[j]] * dp[factor]
                        dp[arr[i]] %= MOD

        total_count = sum(dp.values()) % MOD  # Calculate the total count of binary trees
        return total_count
```

Now, we can test the code using the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
arr1 = [2, 4]
print(solution.numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr1))  # Output: 3

# Example 2
arr2 = [2, 4, 5, 10]
print(solution.numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr2))  # Output: 7
```

The code should produce the correct outputs for the given examples.
