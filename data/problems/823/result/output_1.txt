To solve the given task, we can use dynamic programming to build the binary trees. We'll start by sorting the array in ascending order.

Let's define a dp array, where dp[i] represents the number of binary trees that can be formed using the elements up to arr[i] (including arr[i]).

We can initialize all elements in dp to 1 because each individual element forms a valid binary tree.

Then, for each element arr[i], we iterate over all the previous elements arr[j] (where j < i). If arr[i] is divisible by arr[j], it means arr[j] can be the left child, and arr[i] / arr[j] can be the right child. We can then calculate the number of binary trees using the left and right children as dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[arr[i] / arr[j]].

Finally, we sum up all the values in the dp array to get the total number of binary trees that can be formed.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        arr.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [1] * n  # Initialize dp array with all elements set to 1

        # Iterate over each element in the array
        for i in range(n):
            # Iterate over all previous elements
            for j in range(i):
                if arr[i] % arr[j] == 0:
                    # If arr[j] is a factor of arr[i], calculate the number of binary trees
                    # using arr[j] as the left child and arr[i] / arr[j] as the right child
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j] * dp.get(arr[i] // arr[j], 0)) % MOD

        # Sum up all the values in the dp array to get the total number of binary trees
        return sum(dp) % MOD
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array.
