Here's the implementation of the task in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfExist(self, arr):
        num_count = {}
        for num in arr:
            if num * 2 in num_count or num / 2 in num_count:
                return True
            num_count[num] = True
        return False
```

Explanation:
1. We iterate through the array `arr` and check for each number if its double or half is present in the `num_count` dictionary.
2. If we find either `num * 2` or `num / 2` in the `num_count` dictionary, we return `True` because we have found two indices `i` and `j` such that `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`.
3. If we reach the end of the array without finding a match, we return `False` because there are no two indices satisfying the given conditions.

Note: The `Solution` class is defined to match the template provided in the question. However, it's not necessary to use a class for this task. You can simply define the `checkIfExist` function without the class wrapper if you prefer.
