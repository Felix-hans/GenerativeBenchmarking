You can implement the given task in Python using the following code:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k == 1:
            # If k is 1, we can try all possible rotations and return the lexicographically smallest string
            rotations = [s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s))]
            return min(rotations)
        else:
            # If k is greater than 1, we can sort the string directly to get the lexicographically smallest string
            return ''.join(sorted(s))
```

Here's how you can use the `Solution` class to get the desired output:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "cba"
k = 1
result = solution.orderlyQueue(s, k)
print(result)  # Output: "acb"

s = "baaca"
k = 3
result = solution.orderlyQueue(s, k)
print(result)  # Output: "aaabc"
```

In the `orderlyQueue` method, we check the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, we generate all possible rotations of the string `s` and return the lexicographically smallest rotation. If `k` is greater than 1, we simply sort the string `s` and return the sorted string as the lexicographically smallest string.
