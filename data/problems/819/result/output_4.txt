Here's an implementation of the given task in Python:

```python
from typing import List
import re
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        # Convert the paragraph to lowercase and replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces
        paragraph = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', ' ', paragraph.lower())
        
        # Split the paragraph into individual words
        words = paragraph.split()
        
        # Create a counter for word frequencies
        word_count = Counter(words)
        
        # Remove banned words from the counter
        for word in banned:
            word_count[word] = 0
        
        # Find the most common word
        most_common = word_count.most_common(1)
        
        return most_common[0][0]
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `mostCommonWord` method with the paragraph string and banned words list as parameters. It will return the most frequent word that is not banned in the paragraph.
