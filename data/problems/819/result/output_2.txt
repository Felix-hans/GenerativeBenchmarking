Here's the Python implementation for the given task:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        # Remove punctuation and convert paragraph to lowercase
        paragraph = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', ' ', paragraph.lower())
        words = paragraph.split()
        
        # Count the frequency of each word
        word_count = Counter(words)
        
        # Find the most frequent non-banned word
        max_count = 0
        most_common_word = ''
        
        for word, count in word_count.items():
            if word not in banned and count > max_count:
                max_count = count
                most_common_word = word
        
        return most_common_word
```

In this implementation, we use the `re` module to remove punctuation from the paragraph. Then we split the paragraph into words and convert them to lowercase. We create a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each word. Finally, we iterate over the word counts, checking if the word is not in the banned list and if its count is greater than the current maximum count. If so, we update the maximum count and store the word as the most common word. After iterating through all the words, we return the most common word.
