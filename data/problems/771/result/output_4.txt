Here's the implementation of the `numJewelsInStones` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jewels:
                count += 1
        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numJewelsInStones` method, passing the `jewels` and `stones` strings as arguments. It will return the number of stones that are also jewels.

Example usage:
```python
solution = Solution()
jewels = "aA"
stones = "aAAbbbb"
result = solution.numJewelsInStones(jewels, stones)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

In the first example, there are three stones ('a', 'A', 'A') that are also jewels.

```python
jewels = "z"
stones = "ZZ"
result = solution.numJewelsInStones(jewels, stones)
print(result)  # Output: 0
```

In the second example, there are no stones that match the jewel type ('z').
