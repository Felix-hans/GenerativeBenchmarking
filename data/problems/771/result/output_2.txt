To solve the problem, you can iterate over each stone in the "stones" string and check if it is present in the "jewels" string. If it is, increment a count variable. Finally, return the count.

Here's the implementation of the `numJewelsInStones` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jewels:
                count += 1
        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numJewelsInStones` method, passing the "jewels" and "stones" strings as arguments.

Example usage:
```python
solution = Solution()
jewels = "aA"
stones = "aAAbbbb"
result = solution.numJewelsInStones(jewels, stones)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
