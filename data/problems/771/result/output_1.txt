To count the number of stones that are also jewels, we can iterate through each stone and check if it is present in the jewels string. If it is, we increment a counter. At the end, we return the value of the counter.

Here's the implementation of the `numJewelsInStones` method in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jewels:
                count += 1
        return count
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numJewelsInStones` method with the given inputs to get the desired output. Here's an example:

```python
solution = Solution()
jewels = "aA"
stones = "aAAbbbb"
result = solution.numJewelsInStones(jewels, stones)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

Similarly, you can test the function with other input examples.
