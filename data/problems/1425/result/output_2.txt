Certainly! Here's the implementation of the `constrainedSubsetSum` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        max_sum = dp[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            max_val = max(dp[i - k:i]) if i - k >= 0 else 0
            dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + max_val)
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])

        return max_sum
```

In this implementation, we use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We initialize an array `dp` of size `n` to store the maximum sum of subsequences ending at each index. We also initialize `max_sum` to store the overall maximum sum.

We iterate over the array `nums` starting from the second element. For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate the maximum value in the previous `k` elements (if available) and add it to `nums[i]`. We take the maximum between `nums[i]` and the sum with the previous maximum value to ensure that the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied. We update `dp[i]` with the maximum value and update `max_sum` if necessary.

Finally, we return `max_sum`, which represents the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence that satisfies the given condition.

Please note that this implementation assumes that `nums` and `k` are valid inputs that satisfy the given constraints.
