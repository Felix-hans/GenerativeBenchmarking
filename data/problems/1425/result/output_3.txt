Here's the implementation of the `constrainedSubsetSum` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        max_sum = dp[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Find the maximum sum within the constraint
            max_val = max(dp[i-k:i]) if i > k else max(dp[:i])
            dp[i] = max(nums[i], max_val + nums[i])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])
        
        return max_sum
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence while satisfying the given condition.

We initialize an array `dp` of the same length as `nums` to store the maximum sum of subsequences ending at each index. We also initialize `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

Then, we iterate over `nums` starting from the second element. For each element `nums[i]`, we calculate the maximum sum within the constraint by finding the maximum value in the previous `k` elements of `dp` if `i` is greater than `k`, or in all the elements of `dp` up to index `i` otherwise.

We update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `nums[i]` and the maximum sum within the constraint, i.e., `max_val + nums[i]`. We also update `max_sum` if `dp[i]` is greater than the current `max_sum`.

Finally, we return `max_sum` as the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence satisfying the given condition.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `constrainedSubsetSum` function with the input array `nums` and integer `k` to get the desired output.
