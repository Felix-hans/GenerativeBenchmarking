To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define two variables, "cash" and "hold," representing the maximum profit we can achieve if we don't have a stock and if we hold a stock, respectively.

Initially, cash = 0 (no stock) and hold = -prices[0] (buying the first stock). Then, for each day starting from the second day, we update the cash and hold variables based on the previous day's values.

At each day "i," we have two options:
1. If we sell the stock on day "i," our new cash value will be the maximum of the previous cash value and the previous hold value plus the current stock price minus the fee (cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)).
2. If we continue holding the stock, our new hold value will be the maximum of the previous hold value and the previous cash value minus the current stock price (hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])).

Finally, the maximum profit we can achieve is stored in the cash variable after iterating through all the days.

Here's the implementation of the `maxProfit` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        cash = 0
        hold = -prices[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)
            hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])

        return cash
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxProfit` method with the appropriate inputs to get the maximum profit. For example:

```python
prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9]
fee = 2

solution = Solution()
max_profit = solution.maxProfit(prices, fee)
print(max_profit)
```

Output:
```
8
```

Similarly, you can test the code with different inputs to verify the correctness and get the maximum profit.
