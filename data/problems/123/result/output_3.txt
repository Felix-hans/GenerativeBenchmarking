To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum profit at each day and at each possible number of transactions. Let's go through the code implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize variables to track the maximum profit
        buy1 = buy2 = -float('inf')  # Initial buy prices
        sell1 = sell2 = 0  # Initial sell prices
        
        for price in prices:
            # First transaction: buy at the lowest price
            buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
            
            # First transaction: sell at the maximum profit
            sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)
            
            # Second transaction: buy after the first sell
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)
            
            # Second transaction: sell at the maximum profit
            sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)
        
        return sell2
```

Let's break down the code:

- We initialize `buy1` and `buy2` as negative infinity to represent that we haven't bought any stocks yet. `sell1` and `sell2` are initialized as zero, representing no profit.
- We iterate through each price in the `prices` array.
- For the first transaction, we update `buy1` to the maximum value between the current `buy1` and the negative price (to represent buying at the lowest price).
- For the first transaction, we update `sell1` to the maximum value between the current `sell1` and the sum of `buy1` and the current price (to represent selling at the maximum profit).
- For the second transaction, we update `buy2` to the maximum value between the current `buy2` and the difference between `sell1` and the current price (to represent buying after the first sell).
- For the second transaction, we update `sell2` to the maximum value between the current `sell2` and the sum of `buy2` and the current price (to represent selling at the maximum profit).
- Finally, we return the value of `sell2`, which represents the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `prices` array, as we iterate through the array once.
