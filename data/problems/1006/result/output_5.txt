Here's the implementation of the `clumsy` function in Python to calculate the clumsy factorial:

```python
class Solution:
    def clumsy(self, n: int) -> int:
        stack = [n]
        ops = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            if ops % 4 == 0:
                stack[-1] *= i
            elif ops % 4 == 1:
                stack[-1] //= i
            elif ops % 4 == 2:
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                stack.append(-i)
            
            ops += 1
        
        return sum(stack)
```

You can use the `clumsy` function to calculate the clumsy factorial of a given positive integer `n`. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.clumsy(4))  # Output: 7
print(solution.clumsy(10)) # Output: 12
```

The function uses a stack to keep track of the intermediate results and applies the operations according to the given rules. It iterates from `n-1` to 1 and performs multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction based on the current index and the remainder of the division by 4 (`ops % 4`). Finally, it returns the sum of all elements in the stack, which represents the clumsy factorial of `n`.
