To solve the given task in Python, you can use the following implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return (num - 1) % 9 + 1
```

Explanation:
- The solution follows a mathematical pattern to find the result without any loop or recursion.
- If the input number `num` is 0, the result will be 0.
- For any non-zero number, the result will be `(num - 1) % 9 + 1`.
- This formula is derived from the fact that the digital root (result of repeatedly adding digits) of a positive number `num` is equal to `num % 9` if `num` is not divisible by 9. However, if `num` is divisible by 9, the digital root will be 9.
- By applying `(num - 1) % 9 + 1`, we handle the case when `num` is divisible by 9, ensuring that the result is always a single digit.

This implementation has a runtime complexity of O(1) as it directly calculates the result based on the input number `num`.
