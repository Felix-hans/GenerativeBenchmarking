Here's the implementation of the `numWaterBottles` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        totalBottles = numBottles  # Total bottles consumed
        emptyBottles = numBottles  # Empty bottles left

        while emptyBottles >= numExchange:
            exchangedBottles = emptyBottles // numExchange
            totalBottles += exchangedBottles
            emptyBottles = exchangedBottles + (emptyBottles % numExchange)

        return totalBottles
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numWaterBottles` method, passing the `numBottles` and `numExchange` as arguments, to get the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

Here's an example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
numBottles = 9
numExchange = 3
maxBottles = solution.numWaterBottles(numBottles, numExchange)
print(maxBottles)  # Output: 13
```

Similarly, you can test it with different values of `numBottles` and `numExchange` to get the desired results.
