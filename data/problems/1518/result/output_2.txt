You can implement the task in Python using the given function signature as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def numWaterBottles(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        # Initialize variables
        total_drinks = numBottles  # Total number of bottles you can drink
        empty_bottles = numBottles  # Number of empty bottles you have after drinking
        while empty_bottles >= numExchange:
            # Calculate the number of full bottles you can get from exchanging empty bottles
            full_bottles = empty_bottles // numExchange
            # Update the total number of drinks
            total_drinks += full_bottles
            # Calculate the remaining empty bottles after exchanging
            empty_bottles = empty_bottles % numExchange + full_bottles
        return total_drinks
```

Here's how the function works:

1. Initialize the `total_drinks` variable with the initial number of bottles (`numBottles`).
2. Initialize the `empty_bottles` variable with the initial number of bottles (`numBottles`).
3. Enter a loop that continues as long as you have enough empty bottles to exchange (`empty_bottles >= numExchange`).
4. Within the loop, calculate the number of full bottles you can get from exchanging the empty bottles (`full_bottles = empty_bottles // numExchange`).
5. Update the `total_drinks` variable by adding the number of full bottles obtained (`total_drinks += full_bottles`).
6. Calculate the remaining empty bottles after exchanging by taking the modulo of empty bottles with the number of bottles required for an exchange and adding the full bottles obtained (`empty_bottles = empty_bottles % numExchange + full_bottles`).
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until you no longer have enough empty bottles for an exchange.
8. Return the final `total_drinks` as the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `numWaterBottles` method with the desired input values to get the result.
