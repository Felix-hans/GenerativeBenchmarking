To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's go through the steps to implement the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(satisfaction)
        satisfaction.sort()  # Sort the dishes in ascending order

        max_coefficient = 0
        total_time = 0
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            total_time += satisfaction[i]  # Add the current dish to the total time
            if total_time < 0:
                break  # If adding the current dish makes the total time negative, stop adding more dishes
            max_coefficient += total_time  # Add the like-time coefficient of the current dish to the maximum coefficient

        return max_coefficient
```

Here's how the solution works:

1. We start by sorting the dishes in ascending order. Sorting allows us to process the dishes from the lowest satisfaction level to the highest, maximizing the like-time coefficient.
2. We initialize `max_coefficient` and `total_time` to zero.
3. We iterate over the sorted dishes in reverse order, starting from the highest satisfaction level. This allows us to add dishes with higher satisfaction levels to the total time first.
4. In each iteration, we add the current dish's satisfaction level to `total_time`. This represents the time taken to cook the current dish and all previous dishes.
5. If adding the current dish makes the `total_time` negative, we break the loop because adding more dishes will only decrease the like-time coefficient. Since the dishes are sorted, any subsequent dishes will have even lower satisfaction levels, resulting in negative contributions to the coefficient.
6. Finally, we add the current `total_time` to the `max_coefficient` and move on to the next iteration.
7. Once the loop is complete, we return the `max_coefficient`, which represents the maximum sum of the like-time coefficients.

Let's test the implementation with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The outputs match the expected results, so the implementation appears to be correct.
