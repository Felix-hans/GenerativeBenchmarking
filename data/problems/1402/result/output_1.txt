To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. The key idea is to sort the dishes in descending order based on their satisfaction levels. Then, we iterate over the sorted dishes and calculate the like-time coefficient for each dish, considering only the dishes with positive coefficients.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort dishes in descending order

        total_time = 0
        max_coefficient = 0

        for sat in satisfaction:
            if total_time + sat <= 0:
                break
            total_time += sat
            max_coefficient += total_time

        return max_coefficient
```

Let's test the function with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The function returns the expected results for the provided examples.
