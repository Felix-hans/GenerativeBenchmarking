To solve this task, we can use the Union-Find algorithm to find and union connected components in the graph. Here's the implementation of the `largestComponentSize` function using the Union-Find algorithm:

```python
class Solution:
    def largestComponentSize(self, nums):
        # Helper function to find the parent of a node in the Union-Find structure
        def find(parents, i):
            while parents[i] != i:
                parents[i] = parents[parents[i]]  # Path compression
                i = parents[i]
            return i

        # Helper function to union two nodes in the Union-Find structure
        def union(parents, sizes, i, j):
            root_i = find(parents, i)
            root_j = find(parents, j)
            if root_i != root_j:
                parents[root_j] = root_i
                sizes[root_i] += sizes[root_j]

        # Helper function to find the factors of a number
        def get_factors(num):
            factors = set()
            for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
                if num % i == 0:
                    factors.add(i)
                    factors.add(num // i)
            return factors

        # Initialize parents and sizes arrays for the Union-Find structure
        n = len(nums)
        parents = list(range(n))
        sizes = [1] * n

        # Map each number to its index in the nums array
        num_to_index = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(nums)}

        # Union numbers that share a common factor
        for num in nums:
            factors = get_factors(num)
            for factor in factors:
                if factor in num_to_index:
                    union(parents, sizes, num_to_index[num], num_to_index[factor])

        # Find the size of the largest connected component
        return max(sizes)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `largestComponentSize` function with the `nums` array to get the size of the largest connected component. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [4, 6, 15, 35]
result = solution.largestComponentSize(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 4
```

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [20, 50, 9, 63]
result = solution.largestComponentSize(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 12, 21, 39]
result = solution.largestComponentSize(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

The implementation works by iterating over each number in `nums` and finding its factors using the `get_factors` function. Then, for each factor, it checks if it exists in the `num_to_index` mapping and performs a union operation between the current number and the factor. This process connects all the numbers that share a common factor.

After the union operations, the function returns the maximum size among the connected components, which represents the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
