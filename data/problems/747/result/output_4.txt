Here's the implementation of the `dominantIndex` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def dominantIndex(self, nums):
        max_num = max(nums)
        max_index = nums.index(max_num)

        for num in nums:
            if num != max_num and max_num < 2 * num:
                return -1

        return max_index
```

You can use the `dominantIndex` function by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the function with the `nums` array as the argument. It will return the index of the largest element if it is at least twice as large as every other number, or -1 otherwise.

Here's an example of how you can use it:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
result = solution.dominantIndex(nums)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = solution.dominantIndex(nums)
print(result)  # Output: -1
```

Note: The code assumes that the `nums` array will always have at least two elements, and the largest element is unique.
