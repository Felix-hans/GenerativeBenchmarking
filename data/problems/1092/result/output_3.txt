Here's the implementation of the `shortestCommonSupersequence` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        
        # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of longest common subsequences
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        
        # Compute the lengths of longest common subsequences
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        
        # Construct the shortest common supersequence
        i, j = m, n
        supersequence = ""
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                supersequence = str1[i-1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]:
                supersequence = str1[i-1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
            else:
                supersequence = str2[j-1] + supersequence
                j -= 1
        
        while i > 0:
            supersequence = str1[i-1] + supersequence
            i -= 1
        
        while j > 0:
            supersequence = str2[j-1] + supersequence
            j -= 1
        
        return supersequence
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `shortestCommonSupersequence` method with the input strings `str1` and `str2` to get the shortest common supersequence. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
result = solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2)
print(result)  # Output: "cabac"
```
