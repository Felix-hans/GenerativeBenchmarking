To find the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's implement the `shortestCommonSupersequence` function based on the provided class signature:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)

        # Create a 2D table to store the lengths of the common supersequences
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        # Fill the table using dynamic programming
        for i in range(m + 1):
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = j
                elif j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = i
                elif str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1

        # Construct the shortest common supersequence using the table
        i, j = m, n
        scs = ""
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                scs = str1[i - 1] + scs
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i - 1][j] < dp[i][j - 1]:
                scs = str1[i - 1] + scs
                i -= 1
            else:
                scs = str2[j - 1] + scs
                j -= 1

        while i > 0:
            scs = str1[i - 1] + scs
            i -= 1

        while j > 0:
            scs = str2[j - 1] + scs
            j -= 1

        return scs
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `shortestCommonSupersequence` method to find the shortest common supersequence for the given `str1` and `str2`:

```python
solution = Solution()
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
result = solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2)
print(result)  # Output: cabac
```

The output will be the shortest common supersequence that satisfies the given constraints.
