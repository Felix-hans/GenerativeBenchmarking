To solve this task, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a helper function `gcd(a, b)` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b`. We will use this function to simplify fractions.
2. Initialize variables `numerator` and `denominator` to 0. These variables will store the running total of the numerator and denominator of the expression.
3. Iterate over the expression and split it into individual fractions. We can split the expression using the '+' and '-' characters.
4. For each fraction, split it into its numerator and denominator using the '/' character.
5. Convert the numerator and denominator to integers.
6. Update the `numerator` and `denominator` variables based on the sign of the fraction ('+' or '-'). If the sign is '+', add the fraction to the running total. If the sign is '-', subtract the fraction from the running total.
7. After processing all the fractions, calculate the greatest common divisor of the `numerator` and `denominator` using the `gcd` function.
8. Divide both the `numerator` and `denominator` by their greatest common divisor to simplify the fraction.
9. Convert the simplified fraction to a string in the format "numerator/denominator".
10. If the denominator is 1, convert the numerator to a string and append "/1" to represent an integer.
11. Return the resulting fraction as a string.

Here's the implementation of the `fractionAddition` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
        def gcd(a, b):
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        numerator = 0
        denominator = 1

        fractions = expression.split('+')

        for fraction in fractions:
            if '-' in fraction:
                sign = -1
                fraction = fraction[1:]
            else:
                sign = 1

            num, denom = map(int, fraction.split('/'))
            numerator += sign * num * denominator
            denominator *= denom

        divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
        numerator //= divisor
        denominator //= divisor

        if denominator == 1:
            return str(numerator) + '/1'
        else:
            return str(numerator) + '/' + str(denominator)
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `fractionAddition` method with the input expression to get the result. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
result = solution.fractionAddition(expression)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
1/3
```
