To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. We'll define a helper function that takes the number of remaining oranges and a memoization dictionary as parameters. The memoization dictionary will store the minimum number of days required to eat a certain number of oranges.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}  # Memoization dictionary
        
        def eatOranges(n: int, memo: dict) -> int:
            if n <= 1:
                return n  # Base case: no more oranges left
            
            if n in memo:
                return memo[n]  # Return memoized result if available
            
            # Try eating one orange
            min_days = 1 + eatOranges(n - 1, memo)
            
            # Try eating n/2 oranges if n is divisible by 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                min_days = min(min_days, 1 + eatOranges(n // 2, memo))
            
            # Try eating 2*(n/3) oranges if n is divisible by 3
            if n % 3 == 0:
                min_days = min(min_days, 1 + eatOranges(2 * (n // 3), memo))
            
            memo[n] = min_days  # Memoize the result
            return min_days
        
        return eatOranges(n, memo)
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minDays` method with the input `n` to get the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges.

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 10
result = solution.minDays(n)
print(result)  # Output: 4
```

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 6
result = solution.minDays(n)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

The solution uses dynamic programming and memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems, resulting in an efficient solution for larger values of `n`.
