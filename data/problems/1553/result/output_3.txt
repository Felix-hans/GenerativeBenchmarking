You can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach. Here's an implementation of the `minDays` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}  # Memoization dictionary to store already calculated results
        
        def dp(n):
            if n <= 1:
                return n
            
            if n not in memo:
                memo[n] = 1 + min(n % 2 + dp(n // 2), n % 3 + dp(n // 3))
            
            return memo[n]
        
        return dp(n)
```

This solution uses a recursive helper function `dp` to calculate the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges. The function uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

In the `dp` function, if `n` is less than or equal to 1, it means there are no more oranges left to eat, so we return `n` (0 or 1). Otherwise, we check if `n` is already present in the memoization dictionary. If it is, we directly return the previously calculated result. Otherwise, we calculate the minimum number of days by considering the three possible actions:

1. Eating one orange: This requires 1 day, so we add 1 to the minimum of the remaining oranges.
2. If `n` is divisible by 2, we can eat `n / 2` oranges. We add the remainder `n % 2` to the minimum of the remaining oranges divided by 2.
3. If `n` is divisible by 3, we can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges. We add the remainder `n % 3` to the minimum of the remaining oranges divided by 3.

We take the minimum of these three options and store it in the memoization dictionary before returning the result.

Finally, we call `dp(n)` in the `minDays` function and return the result.
