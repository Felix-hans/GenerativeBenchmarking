To generate a valid n-bit Gray code sequence, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Create an empty list to store the Gray code sequence.
2. Add 0 to the sequence as the first integer.
3. Create a variable `mask` and set it to 1. This mask will help us toggle the appropriate bit in each iteration.
4. Iterate `i` from 0 to n (exclusive):
   - Create a variable `len_seq` and set it as the length of the sequence.
   - Iterate `j` from `len_seq - 1` to 0 (inclusive) and append to the sequence the result of `(sequence[j] | mask)`.
   - Toggle the `mask` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `mask` and `(mask << 1)`.
5. Return the generated Gray code sequence.

Here's the implementation of the `grayCode` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        sequence = [0]  # Step 1
        
        mask = 1  # Step 3
        for i in range(n):  # Step 4
            len_seq = len(sequence)
            for j in range(len_seq - 1, -1, -1):
                sequence.append(sequence[j] | mask)
            mask = mask << 1  # Toggle mask
        
        return sequence  # Step 5
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `grayCode` function with the desired `n` value to get a valid n-bit Gray code sequence. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 2
result = solution.grayCode(n)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[0, 1, 3, 2]
```

Note: The algorithm will return one of the valid Gray code sequences, but there might be multiple valid sequences for a given `n`.
