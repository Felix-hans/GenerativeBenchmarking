You can use a backtracking algorithm to solve this problem. Here's the implementation of the `Solution` class:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = []
        self.backtrack(s, [], result)
        return result

    def backtrack(self, s: str, current: List[str], result: List[List[str]]):
        if not s:
            result.append(current[:])  # Add a copy of the current partition to the result
            return

        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            prefix = s[:i]
            if self.is_palindrome(prefix):
                current.append(prefix)
                self.backtrack(s[i:], current, result)
                current.pop()  # Backtrack by removing the last palindrome added

    def is_palindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        return s == s[::-1]
```

The `partition` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of all possible palindrome partitions. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the final partitions and then calls the `backtrack` function to generate all partitions.

The `backtrack` function is a recursive function that takes the current substring `s`, the current partition `current`, and the result list `result` as input. It first checks if the current substring is empty. If so, it means we have found a valid partition, so we add a copy of the current partition to the result list.

Next, it iterates over all possible lengths of prefixes of the current substring, from 1 to the length of `s`. For each prefix, it checks if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to the current partition, recursively calls the `backtrack` function with the remaining substring `s[i:]`, and then removes the last palindrome added (backtracks) before moving to the next prefix.

The `is_palindrome` function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse using the slicing notation `s[::-1]`.

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `partition` method to test the implementation:

```python
s = "aab"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.partition(s)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[['a', 'a', 'b'], ['aa', 'b']]
```

```python
s = "a"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.partition(s)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[['a']]
```

The solution follows a backtracking approach and generates all possible palindrome partitions. The time complexity of this solution is exponential, as there can be many possible partitions for a given input string.
