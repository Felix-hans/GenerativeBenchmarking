To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm. We start with an empty partition and gradually add substrings to it, making sure that each substring is a palindrome. Here's the implementation of the `Solution` class:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = []
        self.backtrack(s, [], result)
        return result

    def backtrack(self, s, path, result):
        if not s:
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            prefix = s[:i]
            if self.is_palindrome(prefix):
                path.append(prefix)
                self.backtrack(s[i:], path, result)
                path.pop()

    def is_palindrome(self, s):
        return s == s[::-1]
```

In the `partition` function, we initialize an empty `result` list and call the `backtrack` function to perform the backtracking algorithm. The `backtrack` function takes the current substring `s`, the current partition `path`, and the `result` list as parameters.

The base case of the backtracking algorithm is when the substring `s` is empty. In this case, we have found a valid partition, so we append a copy of the current partition `path` to the `result` list.

In the backtracking loop, we iterate over the possible lengths of prefixes from 1 to the length of the current substring `s`. For each length, we extract the prefix and check if it's a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it's a palindrome, we add it to the current partition `path`, make a recursive call to the `backtrack` function with the remaining substring `s[i:]`, and then remove the last element from the partition `path` before continuing with the next iteration.

Finally, we define the `is_palindrome` function to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `partition` function to solve the problem:

```python
s = "aab"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.partition(s)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[['a', 'a', 'b'], ['aa', 'b']]
```

```
s = "a"
solution = Solution()
result = solution.partition(s)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[['a']]
```

The solution generates all possible palindrome partitions of the given string `s`.
