Here's the implementation of the `partition` function in Python that solves the given task using a backtracking algorithm:

```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        def is_palindrome(string):
            return string == string[::-1]
        
        def backtrack(start, path):
            if start == len(s):
                result.append(path[:])
                return
            
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                substring = s[start:end]
                if is_palindrome(substring):
                    path.append(substring)
                    backtrack(end, path)
                    path.pop()
        
        result = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return result
```

The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.

The `backtrack` function performs the backtracking algorithm. It takes a `start` index to indicate the current position in the string `s`, and a `path` list that keeps track of the current partition. The function explores all possible substrings starting from the `start` index and checks if each substring is a palindrome. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the `path`, and the function recurses with the next index `end` to continue the exploration. Once the end of the string is reached (`start == len(s)`), the current `path` is added to the `result`. The function uses backtracking by removing the last element from the `path` before returning to explore other possibilities.

The main `partition` function initializes an empty `result` list and starts the backtracking algorithm by calling `backtrack` with the initial `start` index of 0 and an empty `path`. Finally, it returns the `result` list containing all possible palindrome partitions of the input string `s`.
