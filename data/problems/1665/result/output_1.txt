To solve the given task, we can sort the tasks based on the difference between the actual and minimum energy required. This way, we can prioritize the tasks that require more additional energy.

Here's the Python implementation of the `minimumEffort` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumEffort(self, tasks: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0])  # Sort tasks based on the energy difference

        total_energy = 0
        initial_energy = 0

        for task in tasks:
            actual_energy, minimum_energy = task
            if initial_energy < minimum_energy:
                energy_diff = minimum_energy - initial_energy
                total_energy += energy_diff
                initial_energy = minimum_energy
            initial_energy -= actual_energy

        return total_energy
```

Now, we can create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
tasks = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 8

# Example 2
tasks = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [10, 11], [10, 12], [8, 9]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 32

# Example 3
tasks = [[1, 7], [2, 8], [3, 9], [4, 10], [5, 11], [6, 12]]
print(solution.minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 27
```

The code should produce the correct outputs for the given examples.
