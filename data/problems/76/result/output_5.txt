To solve the given problem, we can use the sliding window technique along with two pointers. Here's the implementation of the `minWindow` function in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not s or not t:
            return ""
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the count of characters in string t
        target_counts = Counter(t)
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of the window and character counts
        window_counts = {}
        left = right = 0
        formed = 0
        
        # Variables to keep track of the minimum window substring
        min_length = float('inf')
        min_window = ""
        
        # Iterate through the string s using the right pointer
        while right < len(s):
            # Add the current character to the window and update the count
            char = s[right]
            window_counts[char] = window_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
            
            # If the count of the current character matches the target count, increment the formed count
            if char in target_counts and window_counts[char] == target_counts[char]:
                formed += 1
            
            # Try to minimize the window by moving the left pointer
            while left <= right and formed == len(target_counts):
                # Update the minimum window if a smaller length is found
                if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                    min_length = right - left + 1
                    min_window = s[left:right+1]
                
                # Remove the character at the left pointer from the window and update the count
                char = s[left]
                window_counts[char] -= 1
                
                # If the count of the removed character is less than the target count, decrement the formed count
                if char in target_counts and window_counts[char] < target_counts[char]:
                    formed -= 1
                
                # Move the left pointer ahead
                left += 1
            
            # Move the right pointer ahead
            right += 1
        
        return min_window
```

The above code maintains two dictionaries, `target_counts` and `window_counts`, to store the count of characters in the target string `t` and the current window, respectively. We also use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to create a sliding window.

The algorithm starts by incrementing the `right` pointer and adding characters to the window. When a character's count matches the target count, the `formed` count is incremented. Then, the algorithm tries to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer and removing characters from the window.

If the window contains all the characters from the target string, the algorithm checks if the current window length is smaller than the minimum window found so far. If it is, the minimum window and its length are updated accordingly.

Finally, the algorithm returns the minimum window substring.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t, respectively.
