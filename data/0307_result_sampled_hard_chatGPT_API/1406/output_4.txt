My apologies for the mistake in the previous code. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def stoneGameIII(self, stoneValue: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(stoneValue)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = float('-inf')
            take = 0

            for j in range(i, min(i + 3, n)):
                take += stoneValue[j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], take - dp[j + 1])

        if dp[0] > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif dp[0] == 0:
            return "Tie"
        else:
            return "Bob"
```

This code uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum score difference from each position. The `dp` array stores the maximum score difference that can be achieved starting from each position. The algorithm calculates this difference by choosing all possible combinations of taking 1, 2, or 3 stones and updates the `dp` array accordingly.

The winner is determined by checking the value of `dp[0]`. If it is positive, Alice wins. If it is zero, it's a tie. Otherwise, Bob wins.
