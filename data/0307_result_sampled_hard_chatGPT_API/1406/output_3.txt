To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define a function `stoneGameIII` that takes an array `stoneValue` as input and returns the name of the winner.

Here's the updated code that fixes the issues mentioned:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def stoneGameIII(self, stoneValue: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(stoneValue)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a DP array to store the optimal scores
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = float('-inf')  # Initialize each score to negative infinity
            
            # We calculate the maximum score Alice can get by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones
            # and subtracting the minimum score Bob can get in the next turn
            for k in range(1, 4):
                if i + k <= n:
                    score = sum(stoneValue[i:i+k]) - dp[i+k]
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], score)
        
        if dp[0] > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif dp[0] < 0:
            return "Bob"
        else:
            return "Tie"
```

We iterate through the `stoneValue` array backwards, starting from the second-to-last element. For each element, we calculate the maximum score Alice can get by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones. We subtract the minimum score Bob can get in the next turn from Alice's score. We update the DP array with the maximum score possible at each position.

Finally, we check the score at the first position (Alice's turn) in the DP array. If it's positive, Alice wins. If it's negative, Bob wins. Otherwise, it's a tie.

Now, let's create an instance of the `Solution` class and test it with the given test cases:

```python
s = Solution()
print(s.stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # Output: "Bob"
print(s.stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, -9]))  # Output: "Alice"
print(s.stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, 6]))  # Output: "Tie"
```

The code should now produce the correct output for the given test cases.
