To solve this problem, we can iterate through each target word and check if it can be obtained from any word in the startWords array.

For each target word, we iterate through each start word and check if the following conditions are met:

1. The length of the target word is greater than or equal to the start word.
2. All the characters in the start word are present in the target word.

If both conditions are met, it is possible to obtain the target word from the start word.

At the end, we return the count of target words that satisfy the above conditions.

Here is the implementation:
