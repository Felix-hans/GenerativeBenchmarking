To solve this problem, we can iterate over the array and count the number of subarrays filled with 0. We can keep track of the count by maintaining a variable `count`. Initialize `count` to 0. 
For each element `num` in the array `nums`, if `num` is 0, increment `count`. Then, for each element after `num`, if the element is also 0, increment `count`. Finally, return `count`.

Here is the implementation of the `zeroFilledSubarray` function:
