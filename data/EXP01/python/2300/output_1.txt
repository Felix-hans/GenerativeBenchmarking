One way to solve this problem is to iterate through each spell and count how many potions form a successful pair with that spell.

Here is the implementation for the `successfulPairs` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def successfulPairs(self, spells: List[int], potions: List[int], success: int) -> List[int]:
        pairs = []
        for spell in spells:
            count = 0
            for potion in potions:
                if spell * potion >= success:
                    count += 1
            pairs.append(count)
        return pairs
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `successfulPairs` function to test it:

```python
solution = Solution()
spells = [5, 1, 3]
potions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
success = 7
result = solution.successfulPairs(spells, potions, success)
print(result)  # Output: [4, 0, 3]
```

```python
solution = Solution()
spells = [3, 1, 2]
potions = [8, 5, 8]
success = 16
result = solution.successfulPairs(spells, potions, success)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 0, 2]
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the `spells` array and m is the length of the `potions` array.
