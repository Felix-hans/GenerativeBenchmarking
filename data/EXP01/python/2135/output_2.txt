Here is the solution for the given task:

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordCount(self, startWords: List[str], targetWords: List[str]) -> int:
        count_start = [Counter(word) for word in startWords]
        count_target = [Counter(word) for word in targetWords]
        
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(targetWords)):
            found = False
            for j in range(len(startWords)):
                # check if all characters in target word are present in start word
                if all(count_target[i][c] <= count_start[j][c] for c in count_target[i]):
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                result += 1
        
        return result
```

You can test the solution by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `wordCount` method with the given input:

```python
startWords = ["ant","act","tack"]
targetWords = ["tack","act","acti"]

solution = Solution()
result = solution.wordCount(startWords, targetWords)
print(result) # Output: 2
```
