To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in targetWords and check if there exists a string in startWords that can be transformed to it. 
We can do this by counting the frequency of each character in the target string, then iterating through each string in startWords and checking if its character frequencies are less than or equal to the frequencies in the target string.

Here's the implementation of the Solution class:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def wordCount(self, startWords: List[str], targetWords: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for target in targetWords:
            target_freq = [0] * 26
            
            # Count the frequency of characters in the target string
            for ch in target:
                target_freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
            
            # Check each string in startWords
            for start in startWords:
                start_freq = [0] * 26
                
                # Count the frequency of characters in the start string
                for ch in start:
                    start_freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
                
                # Check if the start string can be transformed to the target string
                is_transformable = True
                for i in range(26):
                    if start_freq[i] > target_freq[i]:
                        is_transformable = False
                        break
                
                if is_transformable:
                    count += 1
                    break
        
        return count
```
Note: The code assumes that all strings in startWords and targetWords are valid lowercase English letters, so no additional input validation is included.
