To solve the given problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and calculate the maximum net income for Alice.

Here's the implementation of the `mostProfitablePath` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostProfitablePath(self, edges: List[List[int]], bob: int, amount: List[int]) -> int:
        # Build the adjacency list representation of the tree
        adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(len(amount))]
        for edge in edges:
            adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
            adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
        # Recursive DFS function to calculate the maximum net income
        def dfs(node: int, parent: int) -> int:
            total_income = amount[node] // 2 # Alice's share of the gate at the current node
            
            for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:
                if neighbor != parent: # Avoid going back to the parent node
                    neighbor_income = dfs(neighbor, node)
                    total_income += max(0, neighbor_income) # Only add positive incomes
            
            return total_income
        
        # Calculate the maximum net income starting from node 0 (Alice)
        max_income = dfs(0, -1)
        
        return max_income
```

The `mostProfitablePath` function takes in the `edges` list, `bob` index, and `amount` list as input, and returns the maximum net income for Alice.

To test the function, you can create a `Solution` object and call the `mostProfitablePath` method with the provided test case:

```python
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4]]
bob = 3
amount = [-2, 4, 2, -4, 6]

solution = Solution()
result = solution.mostProfitablePath(edges, bob, amount)
print(result) # Output: 6
```

Similarly, you can test the function with the second provided test case as well.
