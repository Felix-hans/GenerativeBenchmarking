To solve this problem, we can start by initializing an empty list called "result" to store the even integers that will be part of the maximum split. We can also create a variable called "currentSum" and set it equal to 0 to keep track of the current sum of the even integers.

Next, we can iterate from 2 to finalSum (inclusive) using a for loop. For each iteration, we check if the current even integer is less than or equal to the remaining sum (finalSum - currentSum). If it is, we add the current even integer to "result" and update "currentSum" by adding the current even integer.

After the loop finishes, we check if "currentSum" is equal to "finalSum". If it is, we return "result" since we have found a valid split. Otherwise, we return an empty list since no valid split exists.

Here is the implementation of the above approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumEvenSplit(self, finalSum: int) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        currentSum = 0
        
        for num in range(2, finalSum + 1, 2):
            if num <= finalSum - currentSum:
                result.append(num)
                currentSum += num
        
        if currentSum == finalSum:
            return result
        else:
            return []
```

The time complexity of this implementation is O(finalSum/2) which simplifies to O(finalSum) and the space complexity is O(1) since the "result" list does not grow with the input size.
