To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start by creating an empty list `result` to store the even integers that will form the final sum. We also initialize a variable `remainingSum` to keep track of the remaining sum after adding even integers to `result`.

We iterate through all even integers from 2 to `finalSum` (both inclusive). For each even integer `i`, if `remainingSum` is greater than or equal to `i`, we add `i` to `result` and subtract `i` from `remainingSum`. We continue this process until `remainingSum` becomes 0 or we reach the maximum even integer that is less than or equal to `remainingSum`.

Finally, if `remainingSum` is 0, we return `result` as the maximum even integers that sum up to `finalSum`. Otherwise, we return an empty list, indicating that no valid split exists for `finalSum`.

Here is the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumEvenSplit(self, finalSum: int) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        remainingSum = finalSum

        for i in range(2, finalSum + 1, 2):
            if remainingSum >= i:
                result.append(i)
                remainingSum -= i
            else:
                break

        if remainingSum == 0:
            return result
        else:
            return []
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the value of `finalSum`.
