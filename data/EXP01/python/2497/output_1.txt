To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. 

First, we need to create an adjacency list for the given graph. This can be done using a dictionary, where the keys are the nodes and the values are lists of their neighbors.

Next, we can sort the nodes in descending order based on their values.

Then, we can iterate over the sorted nodes and calculate the maximum star sum considering each node as the center of the star graph. For each center node, we keep track of the total sum of the nodes in the star graph and the number of edges included in the graph.

To calculate the maximum star sum, we start with the center node and add its value to the total sum. Then, we iterate over its neighbors and add their values to the total sum. If the number of edges included in the graph is less than or equal to k, we update the maximum sum if necessary.

Finally, we return the maximum star sum.

Here is the implementation of the `maxStarSum` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxStarSum(self, vals: List[int], edges: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        # Create adjacency list
        adj_list = {}
        for u, v in edges:
            if u not in adj_list:
                adj_list[u] = []
            if v not in adj_list:
                adj_list[v] = []
            adj_list[u].append(v)
            adj_list[v].append(u)
        
        # Sort nodes in descending order based on values
        nodes = sorted(range(len(vals)), key=lambda x: vals[x], reverse=True)
        
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        
        # Calculate maximum star sum for each center node
        for center in nodes:
            total_sum = vals[center]
            edge_count = 0
            
            # Iterate over neighbors and calculate total sum
            for neighbor in adj_list[center]:
                total_sum += vals[neighbor]
                edge_count += 1
                
                if edge_count > k:
                    break
            
            # Update maximum sum if necessary
            max_sum = max(max_sum, total_sum)
        
        return max_sum
```

We can test the implementation using the given examples:

```python
# Example 1
vals = [1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20]
edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
k = 2
print(Solution().maxStarSum(vals, edges, k)) # Output: 16

# Example 2
vals = [-5]
edges = []
k = 0
print(Solution().maxStarSum(vals, edges, k)) # Output: -5
```

The output will be:

```
16
-5
```
