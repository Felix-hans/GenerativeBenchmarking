To solve this task, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of different good strings that can be constructed with i zeros, j ones, and a length of k. We will build the array dp iteratively based on the following observations:


- If i is greater than zero, we can append a '0' to any good string with i-1 zeros, j ones, and a length of k-1 to get a new good string with i zeros, j ones, and a length of k. So, dp[i][j][k] += dp[i-1][j][k-1].
- If j is greater than zero, we can append a '1' to any good string with i zeros, j-1 ones, and a length of k-1 to get a new good string with i zeros, j ones, and a length of k. So, dp[i][j][k] += dp[i][j-1][k-1].


Using these two observations, we can build the array dp. Finally, the answer will be the sum of dp[i][j][k] for all valid values of i, j, and k.


Here's the implementation of the Solution class:


class Solution:
    def countGoodStrings(self, low: int, high: int, zero: int, one: int) -> int:
        MOD = int(1e9) + 7
        dp = [[[0] * (high + 1) for _ in range(one + 1)] for _ in range(zero + 1)]

        for i in range(zero + 1):
            for j in range(one + 1):
                for k in range(high + 1):
                    if k == 0:
                        dp[i][j][k] = 1
                    else:
                        if i > 0:
                            dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][j][k-1]) % MOD
                        if j > 0:
                            dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i][j-1][k-1]) % MOD

        ans = 0
        for i in range(low, high + 1):
            ans = (ans + dp[zero][one][i]) % MOD

        return ans


We define the MOD constant as 10^9 + 7 to take the modulo as requested in the problem statement. Then, we initialize the dp array with zeros.

Next, we iterate over all possible values of i, j, and k and update the dp array accordingly. We use the two observations mentioned earlier to update the values of dp[i][j][k].

Finally, we loop through the dp array for values of k from low to high, and add the corresponding values to the answer.

The time complexity of this solution is O(zero * one * high), where zero, one, and high are the given inputs.
