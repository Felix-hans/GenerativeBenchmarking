Here is the implementation of the `repairCars` function in Python:

```python
def repairCars(ranks, cars):
    # Sort the ranks in ascending order
    ranks.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum time to repair all cars
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through each rank
    for rank in ranks:
        # Calculate the number of cars the mechanic can repair with the current rank
        num_cars = min(cars, rank)
        
        # Calculate the time required to repair the cars with the current rank
        time = rank * num_cars * num_cars
        
        # Update the minimum time if the current time is smaller
        min_time = min(min_time, time)
        
        # Reduce the number of remaining cars by the number of cars repaired with the current rank
        cars -= num_cars
    
    return min_time
```

You can use this function to find the minimum time taken to repair all the cars for a given `ranks` list and `cars` count. For example:

```python
ranks = [4, 2, 3, 1]
cars = 10

print(repairCars(ranks, cars))
```

Output:
```
16
