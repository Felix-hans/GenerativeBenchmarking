To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from the start cell to all other cells in the grid. We will keep track of the distances, prices, row numbers, and column numbers for each cell. Then, we can filter the cells that have a price within the given range and sort them based on their rank criteria.

Here is the implementation in Python:

```
import heapq

class Solution:
    def highestRankedKItems(self, grid, pricing, start, k):
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        # Initialize the distance, price, row, and column arrays
        distance = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
        price = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        row = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        col = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Define the directions for adjacent cells
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        # Create a priority queue to store the cells based on their distance
        queue = []
        heapq.heappush(queue, (0, pricing[0], start[0], start[1]))
        
        while queue:
            curr_dist, curr_price, curr_row, curr_col = heapq.heappop(queue)
            
            # If the current cell has already been visited with a shorter distance, skip it
            if distance[curr_row][curr_col] < curr_dist:
                continue
            
            # Update the distance, price, row, and column arrays for the current cell
            distance[curr_row][curr_col] = curr_dist
            price[curr_row][curr_col] = curr_price
            row[curr_row][curr_col] = curr_row
            col[curr_row][curr_col] = curr_col
            
            # Check adjacent cells and add them to the priority queue if they have not been visited yet
            for direction in directions:
                next_row = curr_row + direction[0]
                next_col = curr_col + direction[1]
                
                # Check if the next cell is within the grid boundaries
                if 0 <= next_row < m and 0 <= next_col < n:
                    next_dist = curr_dist + 1
                    next_price = max(curr_price, grid[next_row][next_col])
                    
                    # If the next cell has a shorter distance, add it to the priority queue
                    if next_dist < distance[next_row][next_col]:
                        heapq.heappush(queue, (next_dist, next_price, next_row, next_col))
        
        # Create a list to store the cells that have a price within the given range
        items = []
        
        # Iterate through all cells in the grid
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                curr_price = price[i][j]
                
                # Check if the price is within the given range
                if pricing[0] <= curr_price <= pricing[1]:
                    # Add the cell to the list with its rank criteria
                    items.append((distance[i][j], curr_price, row[i][j], col[i][j]))
        
        # Sort the items based on their rank criteria (distance, price, row, column)
        items.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Get the k highest ranked items
        top_items = [[item[2], item[3]] for item in items[:k]]
        
        return top_items
```

Time Complexity: The Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of O((m+n)log(m+n)), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. Sorting the items based on their rank criteria takes O(klogk) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O((m+n)log(m+n) + klogk).

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(m*n) to store the distance, price, row, and column arrays, and O(m+n) for the priority queue. Therefore, the total space complexity is O(m*n + m+n), which can be simplified to O(m*n).
