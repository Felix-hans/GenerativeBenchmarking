One approach to solve this problem is to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from the starting position to all reachable item cells within the price range. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the cells with their distances, prices, row numbers, and column numbers. As we traverse the grid, we update the distances and prices of the cells as necessary.

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def highestRankedKItems(self, grid: List[List[int]], pricing: List[int], start: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        low, high = pricing

        # Initialize priority queue
        pq = []
        heapq.heappush(pq, (0, low, start[0], start[1]))
        
        # Initialize visited set
        visited = set()
        
        # Initialize result list
        results = []
        
        while pq and len(results) < k:
            dist, price, row, col = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if (row, col) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((row, col))
            
            # Check if the cell has an item with the price range
            if low <= grid[row][col] <= high:
                results.append([row, col])
            
            # Explore adjacent cells
            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and (new_row, new_col) not in visited:
                    new_dist = dist + 1
                    new_price = min(price, grid[new_row][new_col])
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, new_price, new_row, new_col))
        
        return results
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n * log(k)), where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, and k is the number of items to find.
