Here is an implementation of the Robot class in Python:

```
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
        self.direction = "East"
    
    def step(self, num: int) -> None:
        for _ in range(num):
            if self.direction == "North":
                if self.y + 1 < self.height:
                    self.y += 1
                else:
                    self.direction = "West"
            elif self.direction == "East":
                if self.x + 1 < self.width:
                    self.x += 1
                else:
                    self.direction = "North"
                    self.y += 1
            elif self.direction == "South":
                if self.y - 1 >= 0:
                    self.y -= 1
                else:
                    self.direction = "East"
                    self.x += 1
            elif self.direction == "West":
                if self.x - 1 >= 0:
                    self.x -= 1
                else:
                    self.direction = "South"
                    self.y -= 1
    
    def getPos(self) -> List[int]:
        return [self.x, self.y]
    
    def getDir(self) -> str:
        return self.direction
```

I've added implementation for the `__init__`, `step`, `getPos`, and `getDir` methods. The `__init__` method initializes the robot's position and direction. The `step` method updates the robot's position based on the number of steps provided, and handles the logic for turning the robot's direction when it reaches the grid boundaries. The `getPos` method returns the current position of the robot as an array, and the `getDir` method returns the current direction of the robot as a string.

Note that I've used the variable names `x` and `y` to represent the robot's position, where `x` corresponds to the column and `y` corresponds to the row.
