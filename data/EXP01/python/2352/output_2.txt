To solve this task, we can iterate over each row and column separately and compare the elements using the '==' operator. If a row and column are equal, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter.

Here is the implementation of the `equalPairs` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i] == [row[j] for row in grid]:
                    count += 1
        return count
```

Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid matrix.
Space complexity: O(1)
