Here is the implementation of the given task in Python:

```
class Solution:
    def triangularSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        while len(nums) > 1:
            new_nums = []
            for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
                new_nums.append((nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10)
            nums = new_nums
        return nums[0]
```

Explanation:
1. We start by checking if the length of the given array 'nums' is greater than 1. If it is, we continue with the process.
2. Inside the while loop, we create a new empty list 'new_nums'.
3. We iterate over the elements of 'nums' using a for loop, from index 0 to index len(nums)-2.
4. In each iteration, we calculate the sum of the current element and the next element (nums[i] + nums[i+1]), and then take its modulo by 10 to get the remainder.
5. We append this remainder to the 'new_nums' list.
6. After the for loop ends, we replace the 'nums' list with the 'new_nums' list.
7. We repeat this process until the length of 'nums' becomes 1.
8. Finally, we return the only element present in 'nums', which is the triangular sum.
