One way to approach this problem is to use a loop to repeat the process until there is only one element left in the array.

Here's an implementation of the `triangularSum` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def triangularSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        while len(nums) > 1:
            new_nums = []
            for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
                new_nums.append((nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10)
            nums = new_nums
        return nums[0]
```

In each iteration of the loop, we create a new array `new_nums` and calculate the new values based on the given formula. Then, we assign `new_nums` to `nums` and continue the process until there is only one element left.

Finally, we return the remaining element, which is the triangular sum of `nums`.
