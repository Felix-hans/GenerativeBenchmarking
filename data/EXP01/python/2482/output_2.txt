To calculate the difference matrix `diff`, we need to calculate the number of ones and zeros in each row and column of the given binary matrix `grid`.

Here's the implementation of the `onesMinusZeros` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def onesMinusZeros(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Calculate the number of ones and zeros for each row and column
        ones_row = [0] * m
        ones_col = [0] * n
        zeros_row = [0] * m
        zeros_col = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    ones_row[i] += 1
                    ones_col[j] += 1
                else:
                    zeros_row[i] += 1
                    zeros_col[j] += 1
        
        # Calculate the difference matrix
        diff = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                diff[i][j] = ones_row[i] + ones_col[j] - zeros_row[i] - zeros_col[j]
        
        return diff
```

We can test the implementation with the given examples:

```python
s = Solution()
grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
print(s.onesMinusZeros(grid))
# Output: [[0,0,4],[0,0,4],[-2,-2,2]]

grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
print(s.onesMinusZeros(grid))
# Output: [[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]
```
