One way to implement the above task is as follows:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def onesMinusZeros(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        onesRow = [0] * m
        onesCol = [0] * n
        zerosRow = [0] * m
        zerosCol = [0] * n
        
        # Count the number of ones and zeros in each row and column
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    onesRow[i] += 1
                    onesCol[j] += 1
                else:
                    zerosRow[i] += 1
                    zerosCol[j] += 1
        
        # Calculate the difference matrix
        diff = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                diff[i][j] = onesRow[i] + onesCol[j] - zerosRow[i] - zerosCol[j]
        
        return diff
```

You can test the solution with the provided examples:

```python
s = Solution()
grid = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]
print(s.onesMinusZeros(grid))
# Output: [[0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 4], [-2, -2, 2]]

grid = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]
print(s.onesMinusZeros(grid))
# Output: [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]
```

Note that I created an instance method `onesMinusZeros` instead of a static method. If you want to make it a static method, you can remove the `self` parameter and call it directly with `Solution.onesMinusZeros(grid)`.
