Here is the solution to the problem:

```go
type FrequencyTracker struct {
    numbers map[int]int
}

func Constructor() FrequencyTracker {
    return FrequencyTracker{
        numbers: make(map[int]int),
    }
}

func (ft *FrequencyTracker) Add(number int) {
    ft.numbers[number]++
}

func (ft *FrequencyTracker) DeleteOne(number int) {
    if _, ok := ft.numbers[number]; ok {
        ft.numbers[number]--
        if ft.numbers[number] == 0 {
            delete(ft.numbers, number)
        }
    }
}

func (ft *FrequencyTracker) HasFrequency(frequency int) bool {
    for _, count := range ft.numbers {
        if count == frequency {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

Explanation:
- I created a struct `FrequencyTracker` with a field `numbers` which is a map[int]int to keep track of the numbers and their frequencies.
- In the `Constructor` function, I initialized the `numbers` map.
- In the `Add` function, I simply added the number to the `numbers` map and incremented its count.
- In the `DeleteOne` function, I checked if the number is present in the `numbers` map. If it is, then I decremented its count and if the count becomes zero, I deleted the number from the map.
- In the `HasFrequency` function, I looped through the counts in the `numbers` map and checked if any count is equal to the given frequency. If yes, then I returned true.
- Finally, I returned the required functions as mentioned in the problem statement.
