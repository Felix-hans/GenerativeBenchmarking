Here is one possible implementation of the `equalPairs` function in Go:

```
func equalPairs(grid [][]int) int {
    count := 0
    n := len(grid)

    rowCounts := make(map[string]int)
    colCounts := make(map[string]int)

    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        rowKey := fmt.Sprintf("%v", grid[i])
        rowCounts[rowKey]++

        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            colKey := fmt.Sprintf("%v", grid[j][i])
            colCounts[colKey]++
        }
    }

    for _, count := range rowCounts {
        countPairs := count * (count - 1) / 2
        countPairs -= count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) / 6 // Subtract combinations where three rows have the same elements

        countPairs *= 2 // Multiply by 2 to count both row-column and column-row pairs

        countPairs -= count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) * (count - 3) / 24 // Subtract combinations where four rows have the same elements
        countPairs += count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) * (count - 3) * (count - 4) / 120 // Add combinations where all five rows have the same elements

        countPairs /= 2 // Divide by 2 to remove double counting of row-column and column-row pairs
