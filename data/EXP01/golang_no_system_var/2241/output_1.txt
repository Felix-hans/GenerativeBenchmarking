            numNotes = a.banknotesCount[i]
        }

        // Reduce the remaining amount and update the withdrawCounts array
        remainingAmount -= numNotes * denominations[i]
        withdrawCounts[i] = numNotes
    }

    // If the remaining amount is not zero, it means there are not enough banknotes in the ATM to fulfill the withdrawal
    if remainingAmount != 0 {
        return []int{-1}
    }

    // Update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        a.banknotesCount[i] -= withdrawCounts[i]

var denominations = []int{20, 50, 100, 200, 500}
```

I have added the code to implement the ATM class and the withdraw and deposit methods. The constructor initializes an empty ATM object. The deposit method updates the number of banknotes in the ATM after depositing new banknotes. The withdraw method calculates the number of banknotes to be handed to the user and updates the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing. The array `withdrawCounts` is used to keep track of the number of banknotes to be handed to the user in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500. If there are not enough banknotes in the ATM to fulfill the withdrawal, the method returns [-1].
