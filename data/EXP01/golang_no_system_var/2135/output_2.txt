To solve this task, we can iterate over each word in the `targetWords` array and check if we can obtain it from any word in the `startWords` array.

For each word in `targetWords`, we can follow these steps to check if we can obtain it:
1. Iterate over each word in `startWords` and check if the length of the current word minus the length of the target word is either 0 or 1. This is because adding a letter will increase the length of the word by 1. If the difference in lengths is more than 1, it won't be possible to obtain the target word from the start word.
2. If the difference in lengths is 0, we check if we can obtain the target word by rearranging the letters of the start word. To do this, we convert the start word and the target word to rune slices, sort them, and compare if they are equal. If they are, we can obtain the target word from the start word.
3. If the difference in lengths is 1, we check if we can obtain the target word by appending a letter to the start word. To do this, we convert the start word and the target word to rune slices and check if the target word contains all the letters in the start word. If it does, we can obtain the target word from the start word.

Here is the implementation of the `wordCount` function:

```go
func wordCount(startWords []string, targetWords []string) int {
    count := 0
    for _, target := range targetWords {
        for _, start := range startWords {
            if len(start)-len(target) == 0 {
                // Check if we can obtain target by rearranging the letters of start
                startRunes := []rune(start)
                targetRunes := []rune(target)
                sort.Slice(startRunes, func(i, j int) bool { return startRunes[i] < startRunes[j] })
                sort.Slice(targetRunes, func(i, j int) bool { return targetRunes[i] < targetRunes[j] })
                if string(startRunes) == string(targetRunes) {
                    count++
                    break
                }
            } else if len(start)-len(target) == 1 {
                // Check if we can obtain target by appending a letter to start
                startRunes := []rune(start)
                targetRunes := []rune(target)
                foundLetters := make(map[rune]bool)
                for _, letter := range startRunes {
                    foundLetters[letter] = true
                }
                possible := true
                for _, letter := range targetRunes {
                    if !foundLetters[letter] {
                        possible = false
                        break
                    }
                }
                if possible {
                    count++
                    break
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

Note: The `sort.Slice` function is used to sort the rune slices in ascending order.
