Here is one possible solution to the problem:

```
func wordCount(startWords []string, targetWords []string) int {
    count := 0
    for _, target := range targetWords {
        for _, start := range startWords {
            if checkConversion(start, target) {
                count++
                break
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}

func checkConversion(start, target string) bool {
    // Create a frequency map for the characters in the start word
    startFreq := make(map[byte]int)
    for i := 0; i < len(start); i++ {
        startFreq[start[i]]++
    }

    // Iterate over the characters in the target word
    for i := 0; i < len(target); i++ {
        c := target[i]
        // If the character is not present in the start word, return false
        if startFreq[c] == 0 {
            return false
        }
        // Decrement the frequency of the character in the start word
        startFreq[c]--
    }
    return true
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each target word and try to find a matching start word by calling the `checkConversion` function. 
The `checkConversion` function creates a frequency map for the characters in the start word and then iterates over each character in the target word. If the character is not present in the start word or its frequency becomes 0 after decrementing, we return false. Otherwise, we continue iterating over the remaining characters in the target word. If we reach the end of the target word without returning false, it means that the target word can be obtained from the start word and we return true.

The `wordCount` function counts the number of target words that can be obtained from any start word and returns this count.
