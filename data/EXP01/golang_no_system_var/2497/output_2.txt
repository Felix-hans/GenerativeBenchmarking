To solve this problem, we can first create an adjacency list representation of the given graph. Then, for each node in the graph, we can calculate the sum of the values of all the nodes in its star graph. We keep track of the k star graphs with the maximum sums and return the maximum sum among them.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty adjacency list called `graph` to represent the graph.
2. Iterate over the edges and add the corresponding connections between nodes in the adjacency list.
3. Initialize a variable `maxSum` to store the maximum star sum found so far.
4. Initialize a min heap called `heap` to store the k maximum sums.
5. Iterate over each node in the graph.
    - Initialize a variable `currentSum` to store the sum of the values of the nodes in the current star graph.
    - Iterate over each neighbor of the current node.
        - Add the value of the neighbor to `currentSum`.
    - If `heap` doesn't have k elements yet, add `currentSum` to `heap`.
    - Otherwise, if `currentSum` is greater than the smallest element in `heap`, remove the smallest element from `heap` and add `currentSum`.
    - If `currentSum` is greater than `maxSum`, update `maxSum`.
6. If `heap` is not empty, iterate over its elements and add them to `maxSum`.
7. Return `maxSum`.

Here is the implementation in Go:

```go
import "container/heap"

type MinHeap []int

func (h MinHeap) Len() int           { return len(h) }
func (h MinHeap) Less(i, j int) bool { return h[i] < h[j] }
func (h MinHeap) Swap(i, j int)      { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }

func (h *MinHeap) Push(x interface{}) {
	*h = append(*h, x.(int))
}

func (h *MinHeap) Pop() interface{} {
	old := *h
	n := len(old)
	x := old[n-1]
	*h = old[0 : n-1]
	return x
}

func maxStarSum(vals []int, edges [][]int, k int) int {
	// Step 1: Create adjacency list
	graph := make(map[int][]int)
	for _, edge := range edges {
		node1, node2 := edge[0], edge[1]
		graph[node1] = append(graph[node1], node2)
		graph[node2] = append(graph[node2], node1)
	}

	// Step 2: Initialize variables
	maxSum := 0
	heap := &MinHeap{}

	// Step 3-7: Calculate maximum star sum
	for i := 0; i < len(vals); i++ {
		currentSum := vals[i]
		for _, neighbor := range graph[i] {
			currentSum += vals[neighbor]
		}

		if heap.Len() < k {
			heap.Push(currentSum)
		} else if currentSum > heap[0] {
			heap.Pop()
			heap.Push(currentSum)
		}

		if currentSum > maxSum {
			maxSum = currentSum
		}
	}

	for heap.Len() > 0 {
		maxSum += heap.Pop().(int)
	}

	return maxSum
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + k log k), where n is the number of nodes in the graph and k is the maximum number of sums to be stored in the heap.
