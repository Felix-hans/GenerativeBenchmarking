To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of different good strings that can be constructed.

First, we need to initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions low+1 and high+1. The value dp[i][j] represents the number of different good strings that can be constructed with i zeros and j ones.

We can fill in the base cases of the dp array. When the target length is 0, there are no good strings that can be constructed, so dp[0][0] = 1. For all other cases where the target length is non-zero, dp[i][j] = 0.

Next, we can use dynamic programming to fill in the rest of the dp array. For each i (number of zeros) and j (number of ones) from 0 to low, we can calculate dp[i][j] based on the previous values in the dp array.

To calculate dp[i][j], we can consider two cases:

1. If we append a '0' to the string, the number of zeros decreases by 1. So dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]. However, we must ensure that i > 0 (there are enough zeros remaining) and that dp[i-1][j] is within the allowed length range.

2. If we append a '1' to the string, the number of ones decreases by 1. So dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]. However, we must ensure that j > 0 (there are enough ones remaining) and that dp[i][j-1] is within the allowed length range.

Finally, the answer is given by the sum of dp[i][j] for i and j within the allowed length range.

Here is the implementation in Go:

```go
func countGoodStrings(low int, high int, zero int, one int) int {
    mod := int(1e9) + 7
    dp := make([][]int, low+1)
    for i := 0; i <= low; i++ {
        dp[i] = make([]int, high+1)
    }

    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i := 0; i <= low; i++ {
        for j := 0; j <= high; j++ {
            // Calculate dp[i][j] based on the previous values in dp array
            if i > 0 && dp[i-1][j] >= low && dp[i-1][j] <= high {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]) % mod
            }
            if j > 0 && dp[i][j-1] >= low && dp[i][j-1] <= high {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % mod
            }
        }
    }

    result := 0
    for i := low; i <= high; i++ {
        result = (result + dp[zero][one]) % mod
    }

    return result
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(low * high), and the space complexity is O(low * high) because we use a 2D dp array of dimensions low+1 and high+1.
