Apologies for the continued issues. I have realized the mistake in the logic. Instead of subtracting `dp[j]`, we need to subtract `dp[j-1]` because `dp[j-1]` represents the number of subsequences formed by considering all previous occurrences of the character except the last one.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSubseqII(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        last_seen = {}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = (2 * dp[i-1]) % (10**9 + 7)
            
            if s[i-1] in last_seen:
                j = last_seen[s[i-1]]
                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[j-1]) % (10**9 + 7)
            
            last_seen[s[i-1]] = i
        
        return (dp[n] - 1) % (10**9 + 7)
```

Now, the code should give the correct output for the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.distinctSubseqII("abc"))  # Output: 7
print(solution.distinctSubseqII("aba"))  # Output: 6
print(solution.distinctSubseqII("aaa"))  # Output: 3
```

I apologize for the confusion caused by the previous incorrect code. This updated code should give the expected results.
