To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's go through the steps to implement the solution in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def distinctSubseqII(self, s: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7  # Modulo value

        # Initialize an array to store the count of distinct subsequences
        dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)

        # Initialize the base case
        dp[0] = 1

        # Initialize a dictionary to store the last occurrence of each character
        last_occurrence = {}

        # Iterate over the characters in the string
        for i, c in enumerate(s, start=1):
            dp[i] = (2 * dp[i - 1]) % MOD  # Double the previous count

            if c in last_occurrence:
                # Subtract the count of subsequences ending at the last occurrence
                dp[i] -= dp[last_occurrence[c] - 1]

            # Update the last occurrence of the character
            last_occurrence[c] = i

            # Ensure the count remains non-negative
            dp[i] %= MOD

        # Return the count of distinct subsequences modulo MOD
        return (dp[-1] - 1) % MOD
```

Let's analyze the solution:

- We initialize the `dp` array to store the count of distinct subsequences. The size of `dp` is `len(s) + 1` to include the empty subsequence.
- We set the base case `dp[0] = 1` to represent the empty subsequence.
- We initialize the `last_occurrence` dictionary to store the last occurrence index of each character in the string.
- We iterate over the characters in the string using the `enumerate` function. The index `i` starts from 1 since we already set the base case.
- For each character `c`, we double the previous count `dp[i-1]` to account for the subsequences without including `c`.
- If `c` has occurred before, we subtract the count of subsequences ending at the last occurrence `dp[last_occurrence[c] - 1]`. This step removes the duplicate subsequences that include the same character.
- We update the `last_occurrence` dictionary with the current index `i`.
- We ensure that the count `dp[i]` remains non-negative by taking the modulo `MOD`.
- Finally, we return the count of distinct subsequences modulo `MOD`.

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `distinctSubseqII` function with the input string to obtain the desired result. For example:

```python
s = "abc"
solution = Solution()
distinct_subsequences = solution.distinctSubseqII(s)
print(distinct_subsequences)
```

This will output:
```
7
```

Similarly, you can test the function with other input strings as well.
