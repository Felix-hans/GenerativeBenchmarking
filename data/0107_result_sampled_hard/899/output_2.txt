Here's the implementation of the `orderlyQueue` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k == 1:
            # If k is 1, we can only rotate the string
            # to get the lexicographically smallest string.
            # We try all possible rotations and return the smallest one.
            n = len(s)
            smallest = s
            for _ in range(n):
                s = s[1:] + s[0]
                smallest = min(smallest, s)
            return smallest
        else:
            # If k is greater than 1, we can select any character
            # and move it to the end. Since we can make any number
            # of moves, we can sort the string to get the lexicographically
            # smallest string.
            return ''.join(sorted(s))
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `orderlyQueue` function with the given inputs to get the desired output. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.orderlyQueue("cba", 1))  # Output: "acb"
print(solution.orderlyQueue("baaca", 3))  # Output: "aaabc"
```

Note that the implementation assumes the input constraints are satisfied, and it may not handle invalid inputs appropriately.
