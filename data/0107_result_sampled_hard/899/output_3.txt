To solve this problem, we can consider two cases:

1. If k is greater than or equal to 2, we can rearrange the letters in any order, so the lexicographically smallest string will be the sorted string. Therefore, we return the sorted string.

2. If k is equal to 1, we need to consider all possible rotations of the string and find the lexicographically smallest one. To do this, we can create all rotations of the string and keep track of the minimum lexicographic rotation.

Here's the implementation of the `orderlyQueue` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k >= 2:
            return ''.join(sorted(s))
        
        min_rotation = s
        n = len(s)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            rotation = s[i:] + s[:i]
            if rotation < min_rotation:
                min_rotation = rotation
        
        return min_rotation
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `orderlyQueue` function with the given input to test it:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "cba"
k = 1
print(solution.orderlyQueue(s, k))  # Output: "acb"

s = "baaca"
k = 3
print(solution.orderlyQueue(s, k))  # Output: "aaabc"
```

This implementation should give you the correct lexicographically smallest string after applying the step any number of moves.
