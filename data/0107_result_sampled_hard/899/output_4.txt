To solve the given task, we can use a different approach depending on the value of `k`. If `k` is equal to 1, we can simply rotate the string by moving the first character to the end repeatedly and keep track of the lexicographically smallest string. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than 1, we can directly sort the string and return the result.

Here's the implementation of the `orderlyQueue` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def orderlyQueue(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        if k == 1:
            min_string = s
            for _ in range(len(s)):
                s = s[1:] + s[0]  # Move the first character to the end
                min_string = min(min_string, s)  # Update the minimum string
            return min_string
        else:
            return ''.join(sorted(s))
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `orderlyQueue` function with the given inputs:

```python
solution = Solution()
s = "cba"
k = 1
result = solution.orderlyQueue(s, k)
print(result)  # Output: "acb"

s = "baaca"
k = 3
result = solution.orderlyQueue(s, k)
print(result)  # Output: "aaabc"
```

This will produce the expected outputs for the given examples.
