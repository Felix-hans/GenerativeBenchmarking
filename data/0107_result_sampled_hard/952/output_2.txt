Apologies for the error in the previous implementation. It seems I made a mistake in updating the parent array and calculating the size of the connected components. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def largestComponentSize(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def find(x):
            if parents[x] != x:
                parents[x] = find(parents[x])
            return parents[x]

        def union(x, y):
            rootX, rootY = find(x), find(y)
            if rootX != rootY:
                parents[rootY] = rootX
                sizes[rootX] += sizes[rootY]

        max_num = max(nums)
        parents = [i for i in range(max_num + 1)]
        sizes = [1] * (max_num + 1)

        for num in nums:
            for factor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
                if num % factor == 0:
                    union(num, factor)
                    union(num, num // factor)

        component_sizes = [0] * (max_num + 1)
        largest_size = 0

        for num in nums:
            root = find(num)
            component_sizes[root] += 1
            largest_size = max(largest_size, component_sizes[root])

        return largest_size
```

In this corrected implementation, I added an additional step to calculate the size of each connected component correctly. After performing the union operation, we iterate over the `nums` array again, find the root of each number using the `find` function, and update the count in the `component_sizes` array. Finally, we return the maximum value from `component_sizes` as the largest component size.

Now the code should produce the correct result for the given test case [4, 6, 15, 35].
