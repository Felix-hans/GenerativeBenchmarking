Here's the implementation of the `fractionAddition` function in Python:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

class Solution:
    def fractionAddition(self, expression: str) -> str:
        fractions = expression.replace('+', ' +').replace('-', ' -').split()
        result = sum(map(Fraction, fractions), Fraction(0, 1))
        return str(result.numerator) + '/' + str(result.denominator)
```

In this solution, we make use of the `Fraction` class from the `fractions` module to perform fraction calculations. The function takes the `expression` as input, splits it into individual fractions, and converts them into `Fraction` objects. Then, we use the `sum` function along with the `map` function to add all the fractions together.

Finally, we convert the numerator and denominator of the result into strings and concatenate them with a `'/'` character to form the final result in the required format.

Please note that the code assumes the input expression is valid and follows the specified constraints.
