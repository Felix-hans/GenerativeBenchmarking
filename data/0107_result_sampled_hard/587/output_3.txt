Apologies for the oversight. The issue in the code is that we are not properly handling the case when multiple trees have the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate. To fix this, we can remove the duplicates after sorting the trees.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def outerTrees(self, trees: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Sort the trees based on their x-coordinate and y-coordinate
        trees = sorted(set(map(tuple, trees)))

        # Function to check if three points make a counterclockwise turn
        def ccw(p1, p2, p3):
            return (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p2[0]) - (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p2[1])

        # Build the lower hull
        lower_hull = []
        for tree in trees:
            while len(lower_hull) >= 2 and ccw(lower_hull[-2], lower_hull[-1], tree) < 0:
                lower_hull.pop()
            lower_hull.append(tree)

        # Build the upper hull
        upper_hull = []
        for tree in reversed(trees):
            while len(upper_hull) >= 2 and ccw(upper_hull[-2], upper_hull[-1], tree) < 0:
                upper_hull.pop()
            upper_hull.append(tree)

        # Combine the lower hull and upper hull to form the convex hull
        convex_hull = lower_hull[:-1] + upper_hull[:-1]

        return convex_hull
```

In this updated code, we first convert the trees to a set of tuples to remove duplicates. Then, we sort the trees based on their x-coordinate and y-coordinate. After that, we proceed with the Graham's scan algorithm to build the lower hull and upper hull.

With these changes, the code should now produce the correct output for the given example and other test cases.
