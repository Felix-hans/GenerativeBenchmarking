Apologies for the previous errors. The issue seems to be with the prefix check in the `dfs` function. We need to check if any word in the dictionary starts with the current word, not the other way around.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Convert the board into a 2D grid for easier manipulation
        grid = [list(row) for row in board]

        # Initialize a set to store the found words
        found_words = set(words)

        # Initialize a list to store the final result
        result = []

        # Iterate through each cell on the board
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                # Perform a DFS starting from the current cell
                self.dfs(grid, i, j, "", found_words, result)

        return result

    def dfs(self, grid: List[List[str]], i: int, j: int, curr_word: str, found_words: set, result: List[str]):
        # Check if the current cell is out of bounds or has been visited
        if (
            i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or
            j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or
            grid[i][j] == "#"
        ):
            return

        # Append the current letter to the current word
        curr_word += grid[i][j]

        # Check if any word in the dictionary starts with the current word
        if not any(word.startswith(curr_word) for word in found_words):
            return

        # Check if the current word is present in the dictionary
        if curr_word in found_words:
            found_words.remove(curr_word)
            result.append(curr_word)

        # Mark the current cell as visited
        temp = grid[i][j]
        grid[i][j] = "#"

        # Perform DFS on the adjacent cells
        self.dfs(grid, i + 1, j, curr_word, found_words, result)
        self.dfs(grid, i - 1, j, curr_word, found_words, result)
        self.dfs(grid, i, j + 1, curr_word, found_words, result)
        self.dfs(grid, i, j - 1, curr_word, found_words, result)

        # Restore the current cell
        grid[i][j] = temp
```

Now you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `findWords` method to solve the problem. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
board = [
    ["b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a"],
    ["a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b"],
    ["b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a"],
    ["a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b"],
    ["b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a"],
    ["a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b"],
    ["b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a"],
    ["a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b"],
    ["b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a","b","a"],
    ["a","b","a","b","
