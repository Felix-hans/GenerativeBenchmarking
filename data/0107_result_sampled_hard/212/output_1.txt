Apologies for the mistake in the previous code. The issue lies in the way the words found on the board are appended to the `found_words` list. Instead of appending `True` when a word is found, we need to append the actual word itself. Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Create a Trie data structure to store the words
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            node = trie
            for char in word:
                node = node.setdefault(char, {})
            node['#'] = word  # '#' denotes the end of a word
        
        # Define the backtracking function
        def backtrack(row, col, parent):
            letter = board[row][col]
            curr_node = parent[letter]
            
            word = curr_node.pop('#', False)
            if word:
                found_words.append(word)
            
            board[row][col] = '#'  # Mark the cell as visited
            
            # Explore the neighboring cells
            for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                new_row, new_col = row + dx, col + dy
                if 0 <= new_row < len(board) and 0 <= new_col < len(board[0]) and board[new_row][new_col] in curr_node:
                    backtrack(new_row, new_col, curr_node)
            
            board[row][col] = letter  # Mark the cell as unvisited
            
            # Optimization: remove empty nodes from the Trie
            if not curr_node:
                parent.pop(letter)
        
        # Iterate through each cell on the board
        found_words = []
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[i][j] in trie:
                    backtrack(i, j, trie)
        
        return found_words
```

Now, the correct word will be appended to the `found_words` list when it is found on the board.
