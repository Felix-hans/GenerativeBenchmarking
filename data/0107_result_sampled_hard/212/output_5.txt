Apologies for the error in the code. The issue lies in how the found words are appended to the `found_words` list. Instead of appending the word itself, we need to append the original word from the `words` list. Additionally, we need to return the list of words in sorted order to match the expected answer. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Define the directions for adjacent cells
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

        # Build a trie from the given words
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            node = trie
            for char in word:
                if char not in node:
                    node[char] = {}
                node = node[char]
            node['_end'] = word

        # Helper function for backtracking
        def backtrack(row, col, parent):
            char = board[row][col]
            curr_node = parent[char]

            # Check if we found a word
            word = curr_node.pop('_end', False)
            if word:
                found_words.append(word)

            # Mark the cell as visited
            board[row][col] = '#'

            # Explore adjacent cells
            for dx, dy in directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dx, col + dy
                if 0 <= new_row < len(board) and 0 <= new_col < len(board[0]) and board[new_row][new_col] in curr_node:
                    backtrack(new_row, new_col, curr_node)

            # Restore the cell value and backtrack
            board[row][col] = char

            # Clean up the trie node if it's empty
            if not curr_node:
                parent.pop(char)

        found_words = []

        # Iterate through each cell on the board
        for row in range(len(board)):
            for col in range(len(board[0])):
                if board[row][col] in trie:
                    backtrack(row, col, trie)

        return sorted(found_words)
```

Now the code will correctly append the original words to the `found_words` list and return the sorted list.

Let me know if you have any further questions or issues!
