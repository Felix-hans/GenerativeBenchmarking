Apologies for the confusion. The issue is that the condition `if '#' in node and node['#']:` is checking if the `'#'` key exists in `node` and is truthy. However, since we're using a set to store the found words, we need to modify the condition to check if `'#'` is in `node` and its value is `True` (indicating a valid word).

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Convert the board into a 2D matrix of characters for easier access
        board = [list(row) for row in board]
        
        # Initialize a set to store the found words
        result = set()
        
        # Define the directions for adjacent cells: up, down, left, right
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        
        # Define a helper function to perform the backtracking
        def backtrack(row, col, node, parent):
            # Check if we have formed a word
            if '#' in node and node['#']:
                result.add(''.join(parent))
                # Mark the word as found by setting '#' to False
                node['#'] = False
            
            # Check if we're out of bounds or if the current cell is not part of the word
            if row < 0 or row >= len(board) or col < 0 or col >= len(board[0]) or board[row][col] not in node:
                return
            
            # Temporarily mark the current cell as visited
            letter = board[row][col]
            board[row][col] = '#'
            
            # Explore the neighboring cells
            for dx, dy in directions:
                backtrack(row + dx, col + dy, node.get(letter, {}), parent + [letter])
            
            # Restore the original value of the current cell
            board[row][col] = letter
        
        # Build a trie from the given words
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            node = trie
            for char in word:
                node = node.setdefault(char, {})
            node['#'] = True
        
        # Perform the backtracking for each cell on the board
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                backtrack(i, j, trie, [])
        
        # Return the list of found words
        return list(result)
```

Now the code should run without any errors and produce the expected output.
