Apologies for the oversight. The previous code still has some performance issues. To optimize the solution further, we can make use of memoization to store the minimum number of days required for each count of oranges. This way, we can avoid recalculating the same counts multiple times. Here's the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}  # Memoization dictionary

        def eatOranges(remaining):
            if remaining == 0:
                return 0  # No more oranges left to eat
            if remaining in memo:
                return memo[remaining]  # Return memoized result

            min_days = float('inf')
            min_days = min(min_days, eatOranges(remaining - 1) + 1)  # Eat one orange
            if remaining % 2 == 0:
                min_days = min(min_days, eatOranges(remaining // 2) + 1)  # Eat n/2 oranges
            if remaining % 3 == 0:
                min_days = min(min_days, eatOranges(remaining // 3) + 1)  # Eat 2*(n/3) oranges

            memo[remaining] = min_days  # Memoize the result
            return min_days

        return eatOranges(n)
```

The updated code uses the same recursive approach as before but adds memoization to store the results for each count of oranges. This way, if we encounter the same count again in future recursive calls, we can directly retrieve the result from the memoization dictionary without recalculating it.

However, please note that for large values of `n`, the code might still run into time limit issues due to the recursive nature of the solution. In such cases, it's recommended to use an iterative dynamic programming approach instead.
