Apologies for the recurring error. The previous implementation indeed had a flaw that caused a maximum recursion depth exceeded error for larger values of `n`. To overcome this issue, we can modify the code to use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach instead of recursion. Here's the updated implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}  # Memoization dictionary
        memo[0] = 0  # Base case

        for count in range(1, n + 1):
            memo[count] = 1 + memo[count - 1]

            if count % 2 == 0:
                memo[count] = min(memo[count], 1 + memo[count // 2])

            if count % 3 == 0:
                memo[count] = min(memo[count], 1 + memo[count // 3])

        return memo[n]
```

In this updated implementation, we use a bottom-up approach where we iteratively fill the memoization dictionary `memo` from 0 to `n`. We start with the base case `memo[0] = 0`.

Then, for each count from 1 to `n`, we calculate the minimum days required based on the three possibilities:

1. Eating one orange and adding 1 to the minimum days required for `count - 1`.
2. If `count` is divisible by 2, we consider eating `count // 2` oranges and add 1 to the minimum days required for `count // 2`.
3. If `count` is divisible by 3, we consider eating `count // 3` oranges and add 1 to the minimum days required for `count // 3`.

We update `memo[count]` with the minimum of these three possibilities.

Finally, we return `memo[n]` which represents the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges.

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `minDays` method to get the correct minimum number of days required to eat the given number of oranges. Here's an example:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.minDays(10))    # Output: 4
print(solution.minDays(6))     # Output: 3
print(solution.minDays(820592)) # Output: 22
```

With this updated implementation, the code should work correctly without any recursion errors.
