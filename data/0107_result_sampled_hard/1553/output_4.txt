Apologies for the error once again. The issue with the previous code is that it doesn't handle larger values of n efficiently due to the recursion depth exceeding the maximum limit.

To address this, we can modify the implementation to use an iterative approach instead of recursion. We'll still use memoization to store the minimum number of days for each number of oranges.

Here's the updated implementation using an iterative approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        memo = {}
        memo[0] = 0

        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            memo[num] = memo[num - 1] + 1

            if num % 2 == 0:
                memo[num] = min(memo[num], memo[num // 2] + 1)
            if num % 3 == 0:
                memo[num] = min(memo[num], memo[num // 3] + 1)

        return memo[n]
```

In this updated implementation, we use a loop to iterate from 1 to n. For each number, we calculate the minimum number of days based on the previous results stored in the `memo` dictionary.

This iterative approach avoids the recursion depth limit and should work efficiently for larger values of n. Please give it a try and let me know if you encounter any further issues.
