To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum number of days required to eat n oranges. We can create a memoization table to store the minimum number of days for each value of n. Here's the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    memo = {}  # Memoization table
    
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return n  # Base case: no oranges left or only one orange left
        
        if n in self.memo:
            return self.memo[n]  # Return memoized result if available
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of days based on the three possible actions
        result = 1 + min(n % 2 + self.minDays(n // 2), n % 3 + self.minDays(n // 3))
        
        self.memo[n] = result  # Memoize the result
        
        return result
```

Here's an example usage of the `Solution` class:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.minDays(10))  # Output: 4
print(solution.minDays(6))   # Output: 3
```

The `minDays` method takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges. The `memo` dictionary is used to store previously calculated results to avoid redundant calculations. The base case is when `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case we return `n` itself.

The recursive formula for calculating the minimum number of days is `1 + min(n % 2 + self.minDays(n // 2), n % 3 + self.minDays(n // 3))`. We add 1 to the minimum of three possible actions: eating one orange, eating `n // 2` oranges if `n` is divisible by 2, or eating `2 * (n // 3)` oranges if `n` is divisible by 3. The `%` operator is used to check divisibility.

We memoize the result before returning it to avoid redundant calculations. This dynamic programming approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for larger values of `n`.
