Apologies for the issue. The code was experiencing a time limit exceeded error because the search operation was not efficiently utilizing the skip list structure. To resolve this, we need to optimize the search method. Here's the updated implementation:

```python
import random

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
        self.down = None

class Skiplist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = Node(float('-inf'))
        self.tail = Node(float('inf'))
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.levels = 1

    def search(self, target: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            if curr.next.val == target:
                return True
            elif curr.next.val > target:
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return False

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        nodes = []
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            if curr.next.val > num:
                nodes.append(curr)
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.next

        insert = True
        down = None
        while insert and nodes:
            node = nodes.pop()
            new_node = Node(num)
            new_node.next = node.next
            node.next = new_node
            new_node.down = down
            down = new_node
            insert = random.random() < 0.5

            if insert:
                if self.levels == node.next:
                    self.levels += 1

        if insert:
            new_node = Node(num)
            new_node.next = self.tail
            new_node.down = down
            self.head = Node(float('-inf'))
            self.head.next = new_node
            self.head.down = self.head

    def erase(self, num: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        found = False
        while curr:
            if curr.next.val == num:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
                curr = curr.down
                found = True
            elif curr.next.val > num:
                curr = curr.down
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return found
```

In the `search` method, I modified the condition `curr.val == target` to `curr.next.val == target`. This change ensures that we compare the target value with the next node's value instead of the current node's value. Additionally, the `search` method now returns `True` when the target value is found, and `False` when the end of the skip list is reached without finding the target.

Please try running the code again, and it should work correctly without any time limit exceeded errors.
