Below is the Python implementation of the Skiplist class:

```python
import random

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, right=None, down=None):
        self.val = val
        self.right = right
        self.down = down

class Skiplist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = Node()

    def search(self, target: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < target:
                curr = curr.right
            if curr.right and curr.right.val == target:
                return True
            curr = curr.down
        return False

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        path = []
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < num:
                curr = curr.right
            path.append(curr)
            curr = curr.down

        insert = True
        down = None
        while insert and path:
            curr = path.pop()
            curr.right = Node(num, curr.right, down)
            down = curr.right
            insert = random.random() < 0.5

        if insert:
            self.head = Node(None, Node(num, None, down), self.head)

    def erase(self, num: int) -> bool:
        found = False
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < num:
                curr = curr.right
            if curr.right and curr.right.val == num:
                found = True
                curr.right = curr.right.right
            curr = curr.down
        return found
```

Here's how you can use the Skiplist class:

```python
skiplist = Skiplist()
skiplist.add(1)
skiplist.add(2)
skiplist.add(3)
print(skiplist.search(0))  # False
skiplist.add(4)
print(skiplist.search(1))  # True
print(skiplist.erase(0))   # False
print(skiplist.erase(1))   # True
print(skiplist.search(1))  # False
```

The output will be:

```
False
True
False
True
False
```

The Skiplist class uses a bottom-up approach to implement the skip list data structure. Each node in the skip list has a `val` representing the value, a `right` pointer pointing to the next node in the same level, and a `down` pointer pointing to the corresponding node in the lower level. The `head` node is the entry point to the skip list.

The `search` method performs a search operation in the skip list. It starts from the top level and moves right until it finds a value greater than or equal to the target. If the target is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it moves down to the next level and continues the search. If it reaches the bottom level without finding the target, it returns `False`.

The `add` method inserts a value into the skip list. It follows a similar approach as the search method, moving right and down until it finds the correct position to insert the value. The insertion process also involves a random decision to create a new level for the value, allowing for efficient searching in subsequent operations.

The `erase` method removes a value from the skip list. It searches for the value and removes it if found. The method returns `True` if the value was found and removed, and `False` otherwise.

Note that the `random.random()` function is used to determine whether to create a new level during insertion. This is what provides the skip list with
