To implement the Skiplist class in Python, we can use a combination of linked lists and randomization. Here's the implementation:

```python
import random

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, right=None, down=None):
        self.val = val
        self.right = right
        self.down = down

class Skiplist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = Node()
        
    def search(self, target: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < target:
                curr = curr.right
            if curr.right and curr.right.val == target:
                return True
            curr = curr.down
        return False
        
    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        nodes = []
        curr = self.head
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < num:
                curr = curr.right
            nodes.append(curr)
            curr = curr.down
        
        insert = True
        down = None
        while insert and nodes:
            curr = nodes.pop()
            curr.right = Node(num, curr.right, down)
            down = curr.right
            insert = random.random() < 0.5
        
        if insert:
            self.head = Node(None, Node(num, None, down), self.head)
        
    def erase(self, num: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.head
        erased = False
        while curr:
            while curr.right and curr.right.val < num:
                curr = curr.right
            if curr.right and curr.right.val == num:
                curr.right = curr.right.right
                erased = True
            curr = curr.down
        return erased
```

This implementation uses a bottom-up approach, where each node has a right pointer to the next node on the same level and a down pointer to the next node on the lower level. The `search` function traverses the skiplist from top to bottom, comparing the values until the target is found or the end of the skiplist is reached. The `add` function starts from the top level and randomly decides whether to insert the number at that level. If it decides to insert, it creates a new node and updates the pointers accordingly. The `erase` function performs a similar traversal as the `search` function and removes the node with the given value if found.

Here's an example usage of the Skiplist class:

```python
skiplist = Skiplist()
skiplist.add(1)
skiplist.add(2)
skiplist.add(3)
print(skiplist.search(0))  # False
skiplist.add(4)
print(skiplist.search(1))  # True
print(skiplist.erase(0))   # False
print(skiplist.erase(1))   # True
print(skiplist.search(1))  # False
```

The output will be:
```
False
True
False
True
False
```

The Skiplist class implements the required methods `__init__`, `search`, `add`, and `erase`. You can create an instance of the Skiplist class and call the methods as shown in the example above.
