To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a 2D array to store the lengths of the shortest common supersequences for all prefixes of the input strings. Then, we'll use this array to construct the shortest common supersequence.

Here's the implementation of the `shortestCommonSupersequence` method in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
        
        # Create a 2D array to store the lengths of the shortest common supersequences
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill the dp array
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        # Construct the shortest common supersequence
        supersequence = ''
        i, j = m, n
        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
                supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
                i -= 1
            else:
                supersequence = str2[j - 1] + supersequence
                j -= 1
        
        # Add remaining characters from str1 or str2
        while i > 0:
            supersequence = str1[i - 1] + supersequence
            i -= 1
        while j > 0:
            supersequence = str2[j - 1] + supersequence
            j -= 1
        
        return supersequence
```

Let's test the implementation with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
print(solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "cabac"

# Example 2
str1 = "aaaaaaaa"
str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
print(solution.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "aaaaaaaa"
```

The output matches the expected results.
