Certainly! Here's the implementation of the `constrainedSubsetSum` function in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n  # dp[i] stores the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i
        
        # Use a deque to store the indices of potential elements in the subsequence
        # The front of the deque will always have the maximum sum element
        dq = deque()
        
        max_sum = float('-inf')  # Initialize max_sum with negative infinity
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Remove elements from the front of the deque if they are no longer within the window k
            while dq and i - dq[0] > k:
                dq.popleft()
            
            # Calculate the maximum sum at index i by taking the maximum of:
            # - The current number nums[i]
            # - The maximum sum of a subsequence ending at the previous valid index (dp[dq[0]])
            dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + (dp[dq[0]] if dq else 0))
            
            # Remove elements from the back of the deque if they are smaller than the current element
            # This ensures that the front of the deque always has the maximum sum element
            while dq and dp[i] >= dp[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            
            dq.append(i)  # Add the current index to the deque
            
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])  # Update the maximum sum if necessary
        
        return max_sum
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `constrainedSubsetSum` method with the `nums` array and the value of `k` to obtain the maximum sum of the non-empty subsequence that satisfies the given condition.
