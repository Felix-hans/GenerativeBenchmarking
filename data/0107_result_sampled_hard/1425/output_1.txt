Apologies for the mistake in the code. It seems that the generator expression in the `max_prev_sum` calculation is not properly parenthesized, leading to a syntax error.

Here's the corrected line:

```python
max_prev_sum = max(0, max(dp[j] for j in queue))
```

By adding parentheses around the generator expression, we ensure that the max function operates on the maximum sum values correctly.

I apologize for the oversight. Please try the updated code with the problematic test case again.
