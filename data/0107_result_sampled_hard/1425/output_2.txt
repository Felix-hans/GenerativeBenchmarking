I apologize for the error in the previous code. The issue is that the dynamic programming approach I described earlier is not efficient enough for larger test cases. We need to use a different approach to solve this problem.

To address this, we can use a data structure called a monotonic queue (or a deque) to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of subsequences. The monotonic queue will store the indices of the elements in descending order of their values.

Here's the updated implementation using the monotonic queue approach:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        queue = deque()
        max_sum = float('-inf')

        for i in range(n):
            # Remove indices from the front of the queue if they are outside the window k
            while queue and i - queue[0] > k:
                queue.popleft()

            # Calculate the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i
            dp[i] = max(nums[i], nums[i] + (dp[queue[0]] if queue else 0))

            # Remove indices from the back of the queue if their corresponding values are smaller than dp[i]
            while queue and dp[i] >= dp[queue[-1]]:
                queue.pop()

            # Add the current index to the queue
            queue.append(i)

            # Update the maximum sum
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])

        return max_sum
```

Now, let's test the updated implementation with the provided test cases:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [10, 2, -10, 5, 20]
k = 2
result = solution.constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k)
print(result)  # Output: 37

nums = [-1, -2, -3]
k = 1
result = solution.constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k)
print(result)  # Output: -1

nums = [10, -2, -10, -5, 20]
k = 2
result = solution.constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k)
print(result)  # Output: 23
```

I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the previous incorrect implementation. This updated code should provide the correct results for the given test cases and perform well even for larger inputs.
