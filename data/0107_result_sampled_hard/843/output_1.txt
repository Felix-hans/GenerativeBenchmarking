Apologies for the confusion. It seems that there's an issue in the provided code related to the condition for the maximum number of allowed guesses. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findSecretWord(self, words: List[str], master: 'Master') -> None:
        n = 6  # Length of each word
        
        # Helper function to calculate the number of matches between two words
        def matchCount(word1, word2):
            return sum(c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(word1, word2))
        
        # Main logic
        def minimizeWords():
            # Set of potential candidates for the secret word
            candidates = set(range(len(words)))

            # Guess and eliminate words iteratively
            for _ in range(10):  # Maximum 10 allowed guesses
                guess = next(iter(candidates))  # Choose a random candidate
                matches = master.guess(words[guess])
                if matches == n:  # Found the secret word
                    return
                candidates = {c for c in candidates if matchCount(words[guess], words[c]) == matches}

        minimizeWords()
```

In this corrected code, I removed the construction of the similarity matrix since we only need to compare the number of matches between words during the guessing process. The `matchCount` function calculates the number of matches between two words.

Please ensure that the `Master` class is correctly defined and provides the `guess` method as specified in the problem statement. With this corrected code, it should now work properly and pass the test cases.
