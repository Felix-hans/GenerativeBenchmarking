Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was an error in the implementation of the `Master` class. To fix the issue, we need to include the `allowed_guesses` attribute in the `Master` class.

Here's the updated code with the corrected implementation:

```python
from typing import List

class Master:
    def __init__(self, secret: str, words: List[str], allowed_guesses: int):
        self.secret = secret
        self.words = words
        self.allowed_guesses = allowed_guesses
        self.guess_count = 0
    
    def guess(self, word: str) -> int:
        if word not in self.words:
            return -1
        
        self.guess_count += 1
        if word == self.secret:
            return 6  # The secret word has 6 exact matches
        
        match_count = sum(a == b for a, b in zip(word, self.secret))
        return match_count

class Solution:
    def findSecretWord(self, words: List[str], master: Master) -> None:
        n = len(words)
        guess_count = 0
        
        while guess_count < master.allowed_guesses:
            # Count the frequency of each character in each position
            char_freq = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(6)]
            for word in words:
                for i, char in enumerate(word):
                    char_freq[i][ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
            
            # Find a word with the minimum elimination score
            min_elimination = float('inf')
            guess_word = ""
            for word in words:
                elimination_score = 0
                for i, char in enumerate(word):
                    elimination_score += char_freq[i][ord(char) - ord('a')]
                if elimination_score < min_elimination:
                    min_elimination = elimination_score
                    guess_word = word
            
            # Make a guess with the selected word
            guess_result = master.guess(guess_word)
            guess_count += 1
            
            if guess_result == 6:
                print("You guessed the secret word correctly.")
                return
            
            # Filter the word list based on the guess result
            filtered_words = []
            for word in words:
                match_count = sum(a == b for a, b in zip(word, guess_word))
                if match_count == guess_result:
                    filtered_words.append(word)
            
            words = filtered_words
        
        print("Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word.")

# Example usage
secret = "acckzz"
words = ["acckzz", "ccbazz", "eiowzz", "abcczz"]
allowedGuesses = 10

solution = Solution()
solution.findSecretWord(words, Master(secret, words, allowedGuesses))
```

Please try running this updated code, and it should resolve the error you encountered. Let me know if you have any further issues.
