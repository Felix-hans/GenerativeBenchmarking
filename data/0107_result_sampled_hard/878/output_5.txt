Apologies for the confusion. It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the problem statement. Let's revise the approach to correctly solve the problem.

To find the nth magical number, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of magical numbers. The pattern is repeated after every lcm(a, b) numbers.

Here's the updated code that fixes the issue:

```python
class Solution:
    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        def gcd(x, y):
            while y:
                x, y = y, x % y
            return x

        def lcm(x, y):
            return x * y // gcd(x, y)

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)

        # Calculate the number of magical numbers within one LCM period
        count_within_period = lcm_ab // a + lcm_ab // b - 1

        # Calculate the number of complete LCM periods in n
        complete_periods = n // count_within_period

        # Calculate the remaining numbers after complete LCM periods
        remaining = n % count_within_period

        # Calculate the nth magical number
        result = complete_periods * lcm_ab

        if remaining == 0:
            return result % MOD

        # Initialize the two multiples
        multiple_a = a
        multiple_b = b

        # Find the next magical number in the remaining numbers
        for _ in range(remaining - 1):
            if multiple_a < multiple_b:
                result += multiple_a
                multiple_a += a
            else:
                result += multiple_b
                multiple_b += b

        return (result + min(multiple_a, multiple_b)) % MOD
```
