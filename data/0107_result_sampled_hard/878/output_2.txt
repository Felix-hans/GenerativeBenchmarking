Apologies for the error in the previous code. It seems that the approach I provided earlier is not efficient enough for large inputs. Let's optimize the solution using binary search to find the nth magical number.

Here's the updated implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def gcd(self, a, b):
        # Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    def lcm(self, a, b):
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) using the GCD
        return (a * b) // self.gcd(a, b)

    def countMagicalNumbers(self, x, a, b):
        # Calculate the count of magical numbers up to x
        return (x // a) + (x // b) - (x // self.lcm(a, b))

    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        # Set the left and right boundaries for binary search
        left = min(a, b)
        right = n * min(a, b)

        # Perform binary search to find the nth magical number
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = self.countMagicalNumbers(mid, a, b)

            if count < n:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        # Return the nth magical number modulo 10^9 + 7
        return left % (10**9 + 7)
```

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `nthMagicalNumber` method to get the correct output. For example:

```python
solution = Solution()
n = 1000000000
a = 39999
b = 40000
output = solution.nthMagicalNumber(n, a, b)
print(output)  # Output: 999860007
```

This updated implementation uses binary search to efficiently find the nth magical number. It calculates the count of magical numbers up to a given value using the `countMagicalNumbers` method, and based on that, adjusts the boundaries for the binary search until it finds the desired result. The final answer is returned modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large outputs.
