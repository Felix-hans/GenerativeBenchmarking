Apologies for the error. The issue is that the code is not correctly handling cases where `n` is smaller than the number of magical numbers in one complete cycle (`magical_numbers_per_cycle`). In such cases, the code should not calculate the complete cycles and should directly find the remaining number. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Solution:
    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        def gcd(a, b):
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        def lcm(a, b):
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)

        # Calculate the number of magical numbers in each LCM cycle
        magical_numbers_per_cycle = lcm_ab // a + lcm_ab // b - 1

        # Calculate the number of complete cycles and the remaining numbers
        complete_cycles = n // magical_numbers_per_cycle
        remaining_numbers = n % magical_numbers_per_cycle

        # Calculate the result based on complete cycles and remaining numbers
        result = (complete_cycles * lcm_ab) % MOD

        if remaining_numbers == 0:
            return result
        else:
            if complete_cycles == 0:
                # If n is smaller than the number of magical numbers in one complete cycle,
                # directly find the remaining number without calculating complete cycles
                for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
                    if i % a == 0 or i % b == 0:
                        remaining_numbers -= 1
                        if remaining_numbers == 0:
                            return i % MOD
            else:
                # Find the remaining number by iterating from 1 to min(a, b)
                # and checking if each number is magical
                for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
                    if i % a == 0 or i % b == 0:
                        remaining_numbers -= 1
                        if remaining_numbers == 0:
                            return (result + i) % MOD

        return result
```

Now, let's test the code again with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 2
print(solution.nthMagicalNumber(4, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
```

The code should now execute without errors and produce the correct results for the given examples.
