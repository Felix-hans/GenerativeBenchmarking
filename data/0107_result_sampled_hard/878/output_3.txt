Apologies for the oversight. The previous code has a performance issue when iterating to find the remaining magical numbers. We can optimize the solution by using binary search instead.

Here's the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        def gcd(x, y):
            while y:
                x, y = y, x % y
            return x

        def lcm(x, y):
            return x * y // gcd(x, y)

        MOD = int(1e9) + 7

        # Calculate the least common multiple
        lcm_val = lcm(a, b)

        # Calculate the count of magical numbers in the range [1, lcm]
        count = lcm_val // a + lcm_val // b - 1

        # Calculate the number of complete ranges
        complete_ranges = n // count

        # Calculate the remaining count of magical numbers
        remaining_count = n % count

        # Calculate the nth magical number in the complete ranges
        magical_num = complete_ranges * lcm_val % MOD

        if remaining_count == 0:
            return magical_num

        # Binary search to find the remaining magical numbers
        low = 1
        high = lcm_val

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            magical_count = mid // a + mid // b - mid // lcm_val

            if magical_count < remaining_count:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        return (magical_num + low) % MOD
```

Now, the code uses binary search to find the remaining magical numbers, which significantly improves the performance. You can use this updated code to get the correct results within the time limit.
