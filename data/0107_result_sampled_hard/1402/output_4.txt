To solve the problem, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to sort the satisfaction array in descending order and then iterate over it to calculate the maximum sum of the like-time coefficient.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort satisfaction in descending order
        max_sum = 0
        total_time = 0
        
        for s in satisfaction:
            if total_time + s <= 0:
                break
            total_time += s
            max_sum += total_time
        
        return max_sum
```

Let's go through the code:

1. We start by sorting the `satisfaction` array in descending order using the `sort` function.

2. We initialize the `max_sum` variable to keep track of the maximum sum of the like-time coefficient and `total_time` variable to keep track of the cumulative time.

3. We iterate over each element `s` in the sorted `satisfaction` array.

4. If adding `s` to `total_time` results in a non-positive value, it means that adding any further dishes will only decrease the sum. So, we break out of the loop.

5. Otherwise, we add `s` to `total_time` and update `max_sum` by adding `total_time` to it.

6. Finally, we return the `max_sum`.

Now, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `maxSatisfaction` function with the given input to test it:

```python
satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
solution = Solution()
result = solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

You can also test the function with the other provided examples and additional test cases to verify its correctness.
