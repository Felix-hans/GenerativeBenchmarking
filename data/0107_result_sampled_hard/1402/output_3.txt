To solve the given task, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We'll sort the satisfaction values in non-decreasing order and then iterate through them to calculate the maximum sum of like-time coefficient.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort()  # Sort the satisfaction values in non-decreasing order
        n = len(satisfaction)
        max_sum = 0
        total_time = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if satisfaction[i] + total_time > 0:
                total_time += satisfaction[i]
                max_sum += total_time
            
        return max_sum
```

Explanation:
1. We start by sorting the `satisfaction` array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize `max_sum` to 0 and `total_time` to 0. These variables will keep track of the maximum sum and the total time respectively.
3. We iterate through the sorted `satisfaction` array in reverse order (from the largest satisfaction value to the smallest).
4. For each satisfaction value, we check if adding it to the `total_time` will result in a positive value. If it does, we update `total_time` by adding the current satisfaction value.
5. We update `max_sum` by adding `total_time` since it represents the time taken to cook the current dish (including previous dishes) multiplied by its satisfaction level.
6. Finally, we return the `max_sum` as the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain.

Note: The solution assumes that the satisfaction levels provided in the input are integers. If the satisfaction levels can be floating-point numbers, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.
