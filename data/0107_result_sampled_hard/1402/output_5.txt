To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. The idea is to sort the dishes in descending order of satisfaction levels. By doing this, we ensure that we start with the most satisfying dishes first.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort dishes in descending order
        
        max_sum = 0  # Maximum sum of like-time coefficients
        total_time = 0  # Total time taken
        
        for s in satisfaction:
            if total_time + s <= 0:
                break  # Stop if adding the current dish decreases the sum
            
            total_time += s
            max_sum += total_time
        
        return max_sum
```

Let's test the function with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The function returns the expected results for the provided examples.
