To solve the given task, we can follow a dynamic programming approach. We sort the satisfaction array in descending order to maximize the like-time coefficient. Then we iterate through the sorted array and calculate the maximum like-time coefficient at each position.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` method:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order
        n = len(satisfaction)
        max_coefficient = 0
        total_time = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if total_time + satisfaction[i] < 0:
                break  # Stop if adding the next dish decreases the coefficient
            total_time += satisfaction[i]
            max_coefficient += total_time
        
        return max_coefficient
```

Now, let's test the solution with the given examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The solution should produce the correct outputs for the provided examples.
