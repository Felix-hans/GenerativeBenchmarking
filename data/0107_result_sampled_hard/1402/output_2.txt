To solve the problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach. The idea is to sort the satisfaction values in descending order and then iterate over them to calculate the maximum sum of like-time coefficients.

Here's the implementation of the `maxSatisfaction` function in Python:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:
        satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort satisfaction values in descending order
        total = 0  # Variable to track the total like-time coefficient
        max_coefficient = 0  # Variable to track the maximum like-time coefficient

        for s in satisfaction:
            if total + s > 0:
                total += s
                max_coefficient += total
            else:
                break

        return max_coefficient
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Example 1
satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 14

# Example 2
satisfaction = [4, 3, 2]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 20

# Example 3
satisfaction = [-1, -4, -5]
print(solution.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction))  # Output: 0
```

The function should produce the correct outputs for the given examples.
