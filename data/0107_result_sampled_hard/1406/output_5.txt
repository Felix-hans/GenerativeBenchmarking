To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. We'll create a dynamic programming table to store the scores for each subgame.

Here's the implementation of the `stoneGameIII` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def stoneGameIII(self, stoneValue: List[int]) -> str:
        n = len(stoneValue)
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # Dynamic programming table

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            best_score = float('-inf')

            for j in range(1, 4):
                if i + j <= n:
                    score = sum(stoneValue[i:i+j]) - dp[i + j]
                    best_score = max(best_score, score)

            dp[i] = best_score

        if dp[0] > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif dp[0] < 0:
            return "Bob"
        else:
            return "Tie"
```

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initialize the length of the stoneValue array as `n` and create a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n + 1`. We add an extra element to handle the base case when all the stones are taken.

2. Start iterating from the last element of the `stoneValue` array (`i = n - 1`) and move backwards.

3. For each position `i`, calculate the best score Alice can achieve by taking 1, 2, or 3 stones. We store the maximum score in the `best_score` variable.

4. Update the `dp[i]` with the best score. This represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve if the game starts at position `i`.

5. After iterating through all positions, we check the score difference at the starting position (`dp[0]`).

6. If `dp[0]` is positive, it means Alice can achieve a higher score than Bob, so we return "Alice".

7. If `dp[0]` is negative, it means Bob can achieve a higher score than Alice, so we return "Bob".

8. If `dp[0]` is zero, it means both players will have the same score, so we return "Tie".

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate through the stoneValue array only once. The space complexity is also O(n) for the dynamic programming table.
