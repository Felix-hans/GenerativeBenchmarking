Apologies for the confusion. The code provided previously indeed has a time complexity issue, and it may not efficiently handle larger inputs. Let's modify the approach to solve the problem more optimally.

Here's an updated solution that should work efficiently for larger inputs:

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def containVirus(self, isInfected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(isInfected), len(isInfected[0])
        walls = 0

        def get_neighbors(row, col):
            neighbors = []
            if row > 0:
                neighbors.append((row - 1, col))
            if row < m - 1:
                neighbors.append((row + 1, col))
            if col > 0:
                neighbors.append((row, col - 1))
            if col < n - 1:
                neighbors.append((row, col + 1))
            return neighbors

        def dfs(row, col, visited, region_number, region, perimeter):
            visited.add((row, col))
            region.add((row, col))

            for nr, nc in get_neighbors(row, col):
                if isInfected[nr][nc] == 1 and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                    perimeter.add((nr, nc))
                    dfs(nr, nc, visited, region_number, region, perimeter)

        def build_walls(region):
            perimeter = set()
            for row, col in region:
                for nr, nc in get_neighbors(row, col):
                    if isInfected[nr][nc] == 0:
                        perimeter.add((nr, nc))
            return perimeter

        def spread_virus(region):
            for row, col in region:
                for nr, nc in get_neighbors(row, col):
                    if isInfected[nr][nc] == 0:
                        isInfected[nr][nc] = 1

        while True:
            regions = []
            visited = set()
            region_number = 2

            for row in range(m):
                for col in range(n):
                    if isInfected[row][col] == 1 and (row, col) not in visited:
                        region = set()
                        perimeter = set()
                        dfs(row, col, visited, region_number, region, perimeter)
                        regions.append((region_number, region, perimeter))
                        region_number += 1

            if not regions:
                break

            regions.sort(key=lambda x: len(x[2]), reverse=True)
            walls_built = regions[0][0]
            walls += len(regions[0][2])

            for region_number, region, perimeter in regions:
                if region_number == walls_built:
                    for row, col in perimeter:
                        isInfected[row][col] = -1
                else:
                    spread_virus(region)

        return walls
```

The updated solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to identify the infected regions and their perimeters. It then chooses the region with the maximum perimeter to build walls around and spreads the virus to the remaining regions. The process continues until there are no more infected regions.

This updated approach should be more efficient and handle larger inputs within reasonable time limits.
