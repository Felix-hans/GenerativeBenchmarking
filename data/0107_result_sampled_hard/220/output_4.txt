I apologize for the incorrect implementation. The previous solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can lead to time limit exceeded errors for large input sizes. We need to optimize the solution to meet the requirements efficiently.

One way to solve this problem is by using a sliding window approach with a sorted data structure. We can maintain a sorted set or a sorted list of elements within the window of size `indexDiff`. By comparing the current element with the elements in the sorted data structure, we can find if there exists a pair that satisfies the conditions.

Here's the updated implementation of the `containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], indexDiff: int, valueDiff: int) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        sorted_set = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i > indexDiff:
                sorted_set.remove(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])
            
            # Find the index to insert the current element in the sorted set
            left = 0
            right = len(sorted_set) - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = left + (right - left) // 2
                if abs(sorted_set[mid] - nums[i]) <= valueDiff:
                    return True
                elif sorted_set[mid] < nums[i]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
            
            sorted_set.insert(left, nums[i])
        
        return False
```

You can use the updated solution in the same way as before:

```python
solution = Solution()
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
indexDiff = 3
valueDiff = 0
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: True

nums = [1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9]
indexDiff = 2
valueDiff = 3
result = solution.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

The updated solution should be able to handle larger inputs without encountering time limit exceeded errors.
