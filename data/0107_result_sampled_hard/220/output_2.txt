To correct the error in the code, you need to remove the leading `b` from the string. The `b` prefix in Python indicates a byte string, but it seems like you're working with a regular string here. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
test_input = "2433,3054,9952,6470,2509,8502,-8802,-5276,6559,-9555,-4765,6399,6543,2027,1723,-3032,-3319,-7726,-1425,-7431,-7492,4803,7952,-6603,-784,-8011,6161,-6955,5800,5834,-6310,1097,2327,-4007,8664,-9619,5922,518,9740,9976,4257,-7803,6023,4189,-5167,-4699,2441,5941,3663,625,5402,-3447,8888,9040,-4811,-7547,6822,1415,9372,-9262,4584,4149,-276,-4019,198,608,-4466,5383,7871,3149,-8358,9270,3565,-882,-9494,-6475,9833,-7744,-598,5299,5976,7361,-9444,3771,-5718,9051,3469,-4028,4216,5506,-8611,-9744,-8007,213,-3454,-2420,6283,-5616,-3508,-1329,4694,-7219,2056,9063,-9648,-7722,-755,-9482,9078,-8411,-3393,-4395,-1203,-2165,2170,8643,-5205,4050,-9322,6178,-973,-331,7559,-7889,3499,-7195,7725,-9155,3899,-5259,1981,4766,595,-7183,4150,-2062,3288,5047,-9789,1507,-4937,5909,-3442,-4599,-789,6931,-3100,-9151,-3665,-4228,-7466,6393,6632,-5133,-7684,4525,1150,3826,-6424,-1689,6206,-5747,8061,1502,-3893,-8528,2387,-6159,-1355,-5789,1361,-1593,-8955,4505,8885,-7793,8038,-8401,9688,6241,2518,7115,-7193,-2735,5665,8331,-1822,-6938,3307,4019,6020,-8340,-7138,4478,-6911,-1241,3829,-5387,-3139,-1707,-187,-9148,-8734,-9570,4666,-9280,-31,-4474,-5569,548,5768,-7954,-9796,9525,-56,-450,-7316,5987,25,-9590,586,-4942,-8193,-3165,6832,1436,-106,-7393,-6921,-9176,8404,1220,9014,224,2145,4099,-3517,-6904,6707,3274,1374,1868,-2740,-304
