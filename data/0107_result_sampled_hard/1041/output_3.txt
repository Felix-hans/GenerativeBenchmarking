To determine whether the robot will stay within a circle on an infinite plane, we can observe the robot's behavior after executing a set of instructions. If the robot returns to the initial position (0, 0) or if it doesn't face north at the end of executing the instructions, it will eventually follow a circular path.

Here's the Python implementation for the `isRobotBounded` function:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Initial position and direction
        x, y = 0, 0
        dx, dy = 0, 1  # North direction
        
        # Execute the instructions
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif instruction == 'L':
                dx, dy = -dy, dx  # Rotate 90 degrees to the left
            elif instruction == 'R':
                dx, dy = dy, -dx  # Rotate 90 degrees to the right
        
        # Check if the robot returns to the initial position or doesn't face north
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or (dx, dy) != (0, 1)
```

This implementation uses two variables `dx` and `dy` to represent the direction the robot is facing. Initially, the robot faces north, which corresponds to `dx = 0` and `dy = 1`. When executing the 'L' instruction, we update the direction by rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise. Similarly, for the 'R' instruction, we rotate 90 degrees clockwise.

After executing all the instructions, we check if the robot returns to the initial position `(0, 0)` and faces north `(0, 1)`. If either of these conditions is true, we return `True`, indicating that the robot will follow a circular path. Otherwise, we return `False`.
