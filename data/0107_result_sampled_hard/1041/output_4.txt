To solve this problem, we can simulate the robot's movements and check if it returns to the initial position or if it changes direction after one cycle of instructions.

Here's the implementation of the `isRobotBounded` function in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # Initialize robot's position and direction
        x, y = 0, 0
        direction = 0  # 0: North, 1: East, 2: South, 3: West

        # Define the directions of movement based on current direction
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

        # Simulate the robot's movements
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                dx, dy = directions[direction]
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif instruction == 'L':
                direction = (direction - 1) % 4
            elif instruction == 'R':
                direction = (direction + 1) % 4

        # If the robot returns to the initial position or faces a different direction
        # after one cycle of instructions, it will never leave the circle
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or direction != 0
```

You can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `isRobotBounded` method, passing the instructions as an argument. The method will return `True` if the robot never leaves the circle and `False` otherwise.

Example usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GGLLGG"))  # Output: True
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GG"))      # Output: False
print(solution.isRobotBounded("GL"))      # Output: True
```

Note that the implementation assumes an infinite plane, so the robot can keep moving indefinitely without ever reaching an edge.
